In order to separate it from my personal e-mail, and more importantly to get more eyes involved, I've setup a new e-mail account for the Rawr Dev Team: WarcraftRawr@gmail.com. Everyone, please use that e-mail for Rawr related e-mails now. Myself, and several of the other devs have access to it, so you're more likely to get a quick response. Additionally, if you've sent me anything in the last few weeks and haven't gotten a response, go ahead and resend it to WarcraftRawr@gmail.com.\n - Significant performance improvements to many models. Some of them *extremely* significant.\n - Rawr.ShadowPriest: Readded Crypt Fever. Mind Flay no longer benefits from Mental Agility.\n - Rawr.HealingPriest: Renamed Rawr.HolyPriest to Rawr.HealingPriest, to make it more clear that it supports both specs of healing priests. Fix for Binding Heal calculations. Added support for Binding Light/Stone trinket.\n - Rawr.Tree: Updated default gemming templates.\n - Rawr.Hunter: Updated default gemming templates.\n - Rawr.Moonkin: Support for Fetish of Volatile Power and Nevermelting Ice Crystal.\n - Rawr.Rogue: Implemented racial expertise bonuses. Modified how avoided white attack are displayed. Crit caps are now shown in the crit display. Fixes for Filthy Tricks not reducing TotT cost, exp/hit calculations, CQC offhand damage, overly high CPG usage in some cycles, overall crit chance, and AP scaling of Eviscerate.\n - Rawr.Elemental: Adjustments to the calculations for Searing and Magma Totems.\n - Rawr.TankDK: Fix for offhand items granting errant mitigation.\n - Rawr.DPSDK: Fix for how custom graphs are displayed. Fix for an issue with the calculation for Rune of the Fallen Crusader. Fix for value of the ICC buff. There is now a custom graph showing DPS in different presences.\n - Rawr.ProtPaladin: Added % Chance to be Crit Without Holy Shield as an optimizable stat, and removed Defense Skill.\n - Rawr.DPSWarr: Now auto-detects Arms vs Fury based on talents, instead of an option on the Options pane. Fix for execute spam in Arms.\n\n\n\n*KNOWN ISSUE*\nThere's a bug that makes Rawr crash when loading old character files for a couple models (mostly priests and warlocks). We'll be releasing a new version soon to resolve this. In the mean time, start a new character (by loading from Armory, most likely).",

It's been held back for a while now by a showstopping issue that we've been trying to work around. I'm pleased to report that we've found an awesome solution to that showstopping issue (Shadowed rocks), and so Rawr3 is nearing public beta. We're tentatively shooting for next weekend (Mar 20/21), but please don't shoot us if something comes up and we're not able to make that date!\n - Vault of Archavon has its own catagory in the filtering. \n - Strength of Wrynn / Hellscream's Warsong Buff have been added to the Temporary Buff section. \n - Almost all healing/dps/tanking models have support for this buff. \n - Items with Resilience now are catagorized as \"Purchaseable PvP Item\" instead of displaying with no source.\n - Rawr.Retribution: Spell selection logic cleaned up.\n - Rawr.Hunter: Hunter rotation logic fixes. 4T10 should be properly modeled now, the DPS value of it was far lower then it actually is.

Important Note for Warlocks\nWe're working on the Warlock model. When you harass our developers, is *slows down* progress, not speeds it up. Contrary to what you may believe, the changes recently have not made Rawr.Warlock any worse. It was entirely broken before (though you may not have known it). Now it's almost entirely accurate and fully functional, with the obvious exception of it missing pets. *Again, we did not 'break' Rawr.Warlock*. Pet support is coming soon. Until then, Rawr.Warlock is not any worse than it was before. If you insist upon wasting our time with discussions, PMs, issues, and reviews about it, at least set your CodePlex account to allow receiving e-mails, so that we can do so.",

Some bosses whose items come from chests are still problematic, but there's at least something there now.\n - Added support for Black Magic in several models. IMPORTANT! Please note however that for models which allow dual weilding, Black Magic does *not* stack, and Rawr doesn't know this yet. It may show dual-Black Magic as the optimal weapon enchants, but really you should only enchant one weapon with it in that case. We're working on a fix for this.\n - Improved handling of PvP gear filtering and source parsing.\n - Fix for downloading talent images from the Armory.\n - Adjusted the proc rate of Berserking and Executioner to match recent testing.\n - Rawr.Warlock: WARLOCKS!

Improved valuing of hit and expertise based on their affect on your rotation. Fix for offhand OB hits not procing rime. Fix for parsing of Sigil of the Hanged Man.\n - Rawr.Cat: Added handling for Victor's Call, and similar recursive special effects.\n - Rawr.Hunter: Fix for a bug with changing pet options.\n - Rawr.RestoSham: Fix for Shard of the Flame.\n - Rawr.Healadin: Fix for Shard of the Flame.\n - Rawr.DPSWarr: Fix for a performance issue with the optimizer and multiple ArPen trinkets. Fixed an issue with sword spec not procing if you only have white attacks selected. Added rage and glancing from sword spec. Added several more default talent specs. Improved tooltips on several of the stats on the Stats tab.\n - Rawr.Rogue: Did a bit of cleanup to the options panel.\n - Rawr.Enhance: Fix for an export to EnhSim issue.

We have decided that even not being completely ready we should make a release so that you can work with all the 3.1 modeling changes.\n - There have been many many changes since 2.1.9. For a full list of changes check the ReadMe.txt. The following are the most important changes and some recent changes since 2.2.0.b6.\n - Gemming Revamp! Rawr will now automatically handle gems, just as you'd expect. See Help > Gemmings for details.\n - Multithreading! Rawr will now better utilize your processor, resulting in a 40% to 100% speed boost for rendering most charts, and optimizing.\n - Special Effects Revamp! Rawr now uses a new system for describing special effects that most trinkets have. You can edit the effects in the item editor. The old custom stats are still in because not all models have transitioned to the new system, but we will be phasing them out in new versions.\n - Talent Optimizer! You can now use optimizer to optimize talents. Not all models have talent optimization constraints available, so in those cases it might be of limited value since it will otherwise tend to skip nonmodeled but otherwise important talents.\n - Glyphs are now part of talent specs! Glyphs now get saved together with the talent spec and there is a glyph chart available now for all models.\n - Default buffs/glyphs! When loading character from armory the models can now automatically enable common buffs and glyphs.\n - NOTE: Rawr 2.2 is not backwards compatible. Please do not copy data files from previous versions of Rawr. Your existing character files should load into Rawr 2.2 just fine, except you'll have to reselect enchants on your gear and glyphs.\n - Rawr.Healadin: More 3.1 changes.\n - Rawr.EnhSham: More 3.1 changes. Updated EnhSim export.\n - Rawr.Retribution: More 3.1 changes.\n - Rawr.Mage: More 3.1 changes. Performance Improvements.\n - Rawr.ProtPaladin: More 3.1 changes and fixes.\n - Rawr.Cat: More 3.1 changes. Updated combo point model.\n - Rawr.Bear: More 3.1 changes.\n - Rawr.Warlock: More 3.1 changes.\n - Rawr.Tree: More 3.1 changes.\n - Rawr.RestoSham: More 3.1 changes.\n - Rawr.TankDK and Rawr.Hunter are not updated for 3.1",

    "Description": ">>A NOTE ON ITEM DATA<<: Before each release, I refresh the data in the default itemcache with the latest data from Wowhead and the Armory. However, at the current time, neither has updated its data for 3.0.8. I've manually updated the DPS on feral weapons, but that's it. I suggest that you use Tools > Update Item Cache from Wowhead / Armory once one of them updates to 3.0.8 data. \n\nRecent Changes:\nv2.1.7:\n\tAll models now contain a Relative Stat Values chart, which dynamically shows the value of various common stats to your current character. Some models had charts similar to this, and most of those still remain, in case they show any additional stats that this universal chart doesn't, but they will be removed in the next major version. As before, remember that these are only outputs from Rawr's calculations, not used internally by Rawr. Also, still remember that they will never be 100% accurate, and to always update whatever you use them for, whenver your gear/enchant/buffs change, in order to maintain as close to accurate as you can.\n\tFixed a couple more bugs with Wowhead parsing, and made it more resilient to errors (won't break your whole item cache update if it does hit an error).\n\tFixed a bug that would clear your available items on reload character from Armory.\n\tYou can now create filters that apply only to gems, or only to gear. (Not used by default filters yet, though)\n\tAdded support for several more trinket proc/effects.\n\tEquipped items will always be shown in item listings, even if they would otherwise be filtered out.\n\tEquipped items will now be marked as available, when re/loading from the Armory\n\tRawr.Cat/Bear: Adjusted calculations for the new FeralAP system. Weapon DPS is now counted as attack power, and items no longer show innate feral attack power. I've manually updated all feral weapons to have their new DPS values, but the actual stats on the items are still from 3.0.3 (ie, there's still Str on them, instead of plain AP). Please refresh the data on these items, once Wowhead/Armory update to 3.0.8.\n\tRawr.Tree: Major improvements all around. Still not fully complete.\n\tRawr.RestoSham: Major improvements all around. Still not fully complete.\n\tRawr.Retribution: Base miss chance lowered to 8%.\n\tRawr.Tankadin: Base miss chance lowered to 8%.\n\tRawr.ProtWarr: Block Value formula changed. Updates to armor calculations to account for Base vs Bonus Armor. Base racial stats updated. Support for the Armored to the Teeth talent.\n\tRawr.HolyPriest/ShadowPriest: Initial Glyph support.\n\tRawr.Mage: Significant updates to 3.0.8 support and to Arcane cycles. Added Rune of Razorice and Lightweave Embroidery. Enhanced hit rating tooltip. Fix for FBScPyro never being chosen when Global Optimizations were on. Added shatter combo cycles for Frost.\n\tRawr.DPSWarr: Initial draft of 3.0 version. Not fully complete yet, but included in this release of Rawr so that you can see how we're progressing. We still advise using Rawr.DPSWarr in conjunction with other theorycrafting tools.\n\tRawr.TankDK: Fixed expertise calculations.\n\tRawr.Rogue/Warlock: Nothing new, yet, but wanted to mention that we have a ton of active development on these models lately, and new versions are coming soon.",

If you have any suggestions/requests for features/fixes in the new version of Rawr, now is the time to let us know! Post on our development site, http://codeplex.com/Rawr/.\n\nBeta 16.1:\n - The beginnings of user-controlled item filtering is in. Let me stress that this is just the beginning. Currently it's hidden away in a menu item (Tools>Refine Relevant Items...), and only supports the most basic filtering by item type (Leather vs Mail, Maces vs Swords, etc.). In the future, we expect to expand upon this greatly, by allowing all kinds of filters (such as by source, by item level, etc), and will be making the UI to control this more intuitive. Please post on our development site, let us know what sort of filters you'd like to be able to create\n - More improvements to the performance and accuracy of the Optimizer\n - The Add Item dialog now accepts whole links to wowhead or thottbot\n - Added Flame Armor Kits, Arcane Armor Kits, and Lesser Arcanums of Resilience to the default enchant list\n - Rawr.Mage:\n - - New custom chart to visualize sequence reconstruction\n - - Couple fixes for sequence reconstruction, especially around handling threat\n - Rawr.ProtWarr\n - - Blessing of Kings now correctly affects Agility",

These are our first versions of these models, so please report any bugs you find with them!\n - Revamp of item availability mechanics: Items can be marked to allow regemming and restrict which enchants are available. Left click on diamond as before marks item to be available withot restrictions (regemming and all enchants), CTRL+click marks the item to be available for this specific gemming. By right clicking on the diamond it is possible to restrict which enchants are available (if there are any restrictions active this is indicated by a dot next to diamond). Optimizer has an option to override whether items that aren't specifically marked for regemming/reenchanting can be regemmed or reenchanted.\n - The optimizer upgrade comparison chart will now display all slots used to achieve the displayed upgrade value in its tooltip, and has a contextual menu item on click to equip all items\n - Significant performance improvements all around for calculations, especially in the Optimizer\n - Fix for properly handling gems and socket bonuses with spell damage and healing, and for display gems with three stats\n - Fixed a bug with encoding for armory lookups, which was breaking some KR character loads\n - Fixed a bug with item selection popups where the highest rating is 0\n - Now handles broken images on the armory gracefully\n - Added Batch Tools. These are still a work-in-progress, and are unstable, but the end goal is to be able to optimize a collection of characters (ie, your guild) at once.

    "Description": "Welcome to Rawr b14. In this beta are two new models: ProtWarr and Healadin. There's also a slew of new features, across all models, and numerous model-specific fixes/additions/changes. Some highlights are Threat for Bears, Sequence Reconstruction for Mage, a massively updated (and much more accurate) calculation model for Moonkin, Mac support, an upgrade list builder, and a much more intelligent Optimizer.\n\nBeta 14:\n - Added the ProtWarr and Healadin models! These are our first versions of these models, so please report any bugs you find with them!\n - Mac support! See the readme for details.\n - Major improvements to the intelligence of the Optimizer\n - Added a new feature in the Optimizer: Build Upgrade List. This feature will take longer than the normal Optimizer (so you'll want to run it at a lower thoroughness, most likely), but will produce a chart of how much value you could gain if you had each item that you don't already have available.\n - Added a Direct Upgrades chart, which shows what the biggest upgrades for you would be, considering just direct upgrades, no other gear swaps. For a comprehensive upgrades evaluation, use the new Build Upgrade List feature of the optimizer.\n - Significantly improved performance all across Rawr, especially in the Optimizer\n - Added a Delete Duplicates function. By right clicking on an item or using the Item Editor, you can Delete Duplicates for an item, which will delete all gemmings of the item except for the one you selected, and any that are equipped.\n - Reworked how Rawr stores calculation options. This means that when you load your characters created with previous versions of Rawr, the Options tab will be reset to default, please be sure to fill that out again.\n - Rawr now correctly handles mainhand and offhand enchants, as appropriate by equipped items.\n - Improved the loading performance of the Item Editor on successive loads. The first time you open it, it should be faster than before, and the second+ time should be nearly instant.\n - Fixed a bug that made the Fill Sockets functionality of the Item Editor not work.\n - Fixed a bug that made the chart render as a big red X occasionally.\n - Made some changes that may help with the UI for users of high-DPI resolutions. High DPI is still not supported (as Windows' support for it is retard and broken), but this should help somewhat.\n - Fixed a leak of control handles in the item selector, should improve performance and prevent crashes related to this.\n - Fixed the Armor Penetration values of Imp/Expose Armor.\n - Reloading the current character from the armory will now load enchants and talents, in addition to items.\n - The Item Selector should no longer extend off the screen when there's room available, on very low resolution displays.\n - Added support for loading characters from KR and TW realms.\n - Load Upgrades from Armory will no longer create duplicates.\n - Added some warnings to the Optimizer to help people use it properly (such as pointing out when you've forgotten to mark any choices in a slot as available). These can be disabled in the Options.\n - See Readme for model-specific changes.",

    "Description": "Rawr Beta 13.1\n------------\n Welcome to Rawr b13. New in this beta are two major new features, the Optimizer, and the Retribution model, as well as a multitude of fixes and improvements to the app in general, and each model. You'll be able to mark items as available to your character, and then use the Optimizer to find the best possible set of gear from all available items, with a variety of additional optional requirements. The Retribute model, developed by Anarkii, will help all the Retadins out there build their gear set!\n\nVersion History\n---------------\nBeta 13.1:\n - Fix for several Optimizer crashes. If you can get the Optimizer to crash still, please e-mail me your character file (cnervig@hotmail.com).\n - Fix for Rawr.Mage requiring .NET 3.5.\n\nBeta 13:\n - Rawr now includes a Retribution model, built by Anarkii! Since it's our first Ret release, it may have some bugs, so please report anything you find wrong with it, and welcome to Rawr, Retadins!\n - Added an Optimizer feature. The Optimizer works by looking at different combinations of gear that you have available (mark items as available by clicking the diamond next to the item in the charts), and finding the best possible set of gear. There's lots to see in the Optimizer, so give it a try, and let us know how it works. One known issue with the optimizer: Unique gems may be used multiple times; best to just not mark any unique gems as Available for now.\n - Added a Status dialog that will show the status of all pending network operations (like loading items from the Armory). Note that there's still no way to cancel these operations while they're in-progress, but we hope to have that in a future update, soon.\n - Improved the performance of loading and saving cached items, and performing some common item stat calculations, and fixed several bugs with the item editor.\n - Items with class restrictions will not show up for other classes.\n - Items will now display a Location, of where to get them. The data for this is still vague or non-existent in some cases, since it's loaded from the Armory, but for the most part it should be useful.\n - All DPS models' DPS rating is calculated in terms of plain DPS (as opposed to DPS*100);\n - Downloads from the Armory should be more resilient now, retrying whenever random failures occur, and correctly supporting more types of proxy servers where needed.\n - The current character name and filename will appear in the title bar.\n - Tooltips are now shown for buffs on the buff selection tab.\n - Buffs and Enchants will now combine the built-in lists with what's in your itemcache, so that you can preserve customizations between versions.\n - Rawr.Bear: Added all missing 2.4 items/enchants to the default ItemCache, resist enchants are now correctly counted, there are now debuffs for Sunwell Radiance and mobs that don't crush.\n - Rawr.Mage: Added more AB-AM cycles, now shows a tradeoff coefficient for all spells, improved rotation and trinket optimization, improved performance, now tracks threat, auto selects Mage/Molten armor,\n - Rawr.Moonkin: Removed the Mana Efficiency rating, since it was already contained in the total damage rating, improved the accuracy of several calculations, added set bonuses, updated mechanics for 2.4, now shows several different damage-related calculations similar to the spreadsheet.",

Last version, Cat was added. That was a pretty big addition, but still limited Rawr's users to one spec of one class. Well, lets octuple that, shall we? Rawr now supports 3 more models: *Moonkin*, *Mage*, and *Warlock*. Please keep in mind that these models are brand new, and in various stages of polish. There will be bugs, there will be missing features. I strongly urge you to come post an Issue on our development site, http://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/, with any feedback you have on Rawr, especially the 3 new models. Dopefish is developing the Moonkin model, Kavan is developing the Mage model, and CBennight is developing the Warlock model. And as usual, there's a number of additional enhancements to core Rawr functionality. Big thanks to Dwin, and Bashui for help on core Rawr functionality. Also, stay tuned, because there are more models in the works. Healadin and Retribution are coming along well, and Rogue, ProtWarr, Protadin, Hunter, ElemShammy, and DPSWarr are beginning development as well. If you'd like to help out with any of these models, a new model, or the project in general, let me know, we could always use a hand.\n\nThis release is dedicated to Gary Gygax. Without him, Rawr probably wouldn't exist.\n\nVersion History\n---------------\nBeta 12a:\n - Fixed a bug that would cause \"Input string not in correct format\" errors when Rawr was run on copies of Windows for a region where a period is not the decimal separator (ie european countries where it would be \"1,23\" instead of \"1.23\").\n - For proxies that filter by user-agent, the user-agent used by Rawr is now customizable in the proxy options.\n - Config settings (like recent files) are now user specific.\n - Fix for occasionally not loading icons immediately even though a network connection is available. Also fixed an error when there was no network connection.\n - Rawr.Mage: Added new AB-AM cycle and new AB cycles with Frostbolt/Scorch filler, added a fix for the item budget comparison, added scrolling on the options screen, added Drums of Battle stacking, \n - Rawr.Warlock: Fixed issue when altering spell cycle\n\nBeta 12:\n - Rawr now includes models for Moonkins, Mages, and Warlocks!\n - Many more stats are tracked about items, for use in new and upcoming models.\n - Fixed a bug in the options for Cat, so that it updates the label for the value of expose weakness.\n - Icons now pull from the more reliable wowarmory.com instead of the old flakey armory.worldofwarcraft.com.\n - You can now safely run multiple copies of Rawr at the same time by duplicating Rawr's folder. Each running copy of Rawr must be in its own folder, with its own cache xml files.\n - Fixed some bugs that would cause Rawr to crash.\n - The Splash screen has finally been redone! It now has a background image, and an icon for each model that is loaded, along with the version #s of each model, Rawr's UI, and Base.\n - Tooltips on the calculations should really last a long time now, for everyone, I hope.\n - The ItemCache should save faster, load faster, and take up alot less space, per item.\n - There's a menu item now, to reload the character data from the Armory for the current character.\n - The Projectile and Projectile Bag slots will now be hidden if they don't apply to the current model.\n - Improved how Rawr handles requests for data from the Armory.\n - When unable to access the Armory will now handle it much more gracefully. If you see blank icons, anywhere, that's probably the case.\n - There's now an options dialog. More will come in there, but for now, there's customizable proxy settings. If you were previously unable to use Rawr due to being behind a proxy that was different from your IE settings, or required different authentication, give this a try.",

    "DevelopmentStatus": "Beta",
    "Description": "Welcome to another new version of Rawr. b11 has quite a few new features that you'll notice, and quite a few that you probably won't notice. I've added alot of polish to the new Cat model, (though those disabled calculation options are still disabled, sorry :( ), and there are several new things for Bear too. There have been alot of changes under the hood, to allow for Rawr to support models for a wide variety of class/specs, not just Cats and Bears. While Feral is still my passion, and will be the main focus of my future development, I also want to open Rawr up so that other people who are passionate about different classes/specs can build models for Rawr, and hopefully all theorycrafters can be united with one common platform. Thanks for work on this release go out to Bashui and MerickOWA!\n\nThis release is dedicated to all those who have dissatisfied clouds hanging over them. Sorry I'm a couple days late.\n\n\nBeta 11:\n - You can now change between Bear and Cat mode, and any other models, on the fly, using the new Model menu.\n - All stats are now editable in the Item Editor, not just bear stats.\n - Rawr has been updated for the 2.4 PTR, as of 2/15. Most of the new items have been added, and the idols have been changed to their new stats. Note that you shouldn't try to Refresh Item Data on a new item, as it'll just fail to find the item and timeout.\n - Added accurate calculations for all the decent cat idols.\n - There's now a checkbox on the Options tab to enable Metagem requirement detection. If you run into a situation where one item is ranked higher than another, and you think it should be the other way around, see if the first one helps you meet the metagem requirements, and the second one doesn't. Turn that option off if you like handling metagem requirements yourself, and it'll always count the metagem.\n - Buffs now have tooltips in the charts.\n - The most recently used model will be selected at startup. No more dialog asking what model you want to startup in.\n - There's now a list of recently opened files in the File menu, so you can open your different gear sets and characters faster.\n - The model system has been changed so that each model is its own DLL, meaning that models can be updated/added/removed seperately of Rawr itself.\n - Fixed a few bugs on dual-monitor setups.\n - Items can now have weapon properties (min/max damage, speed)\n - In order to prepare Rawr for a wider variety of models, the item type/slot system has been revamped. You'll now notice that there are 2 more buttons on the main form, for Projectile and Projectile Bag, though nothing will fit in them for ferals. Same with the offhand.\n - Added support for all races, though Rawr.Cat and Rawr.Bear only have stats for NE/Tauren, of course. This is in preparation for Rawr being used by other classes.\n - Items with no stats relevant to the current model will be hidden from charts/dropdowns\n - There are now several new buffs for cats: ExposeWeakness (which has a slider on the Options tab to control its AP value), and Bloodlust, Drums of Battle, and Drums of War (which have sliders on the Options tab to control their uptime %).\n - Models can now define their own custom charts, which are now used by Cat to include Combat Table (White), Combat Table (Yellow) and Relative Stat Values, and by Bear to include Combat Table and Relative Stat Values. Note that due to rounding abormalities when working with small values of certain stats that get multiplies, the two Relative Stat Values charts aren't as informative as I'd like, yet; take their values with a large grain of salt, consider them alpha quality for now.\n - You can resize the main form to give you more chart space, and more space for the tab control with calculation display, buffs, options, enchants.",

    "Description": "Rawr Beta 10\n------------\n*Cat support*! It's finally here! Cat support has been a long time coming. b10 is a huge upgrade for Rawr. I've added quite a few things for Bears as well. Since there's so much new stuff in b10, I honestly expect there to be a few bugs. I'll be releasing a new version to fix whatever bugs are found, probably within a week. So I ask for your patience in whatever goes wrong with b10. :) It's very important to note that the Cat side of things is only like 80% complete. There are several features that aren't done for b10. Please see the \"Missing Features\" section in the ReadMe, for details. I know some of these are important features, and will be getting them in b11, as soon as I can. Also, because it can't be said enough, huge thanks to Toskk for all of his Cat theorycrafting. Rawr.Cat would not be possible without Toskk.\n\nFAQ\n---\n Q: Why are some features disabled on the Options tab for Cat?\n Q: How do I change the stats of an item for Cat? It still shows the bear stats!\n Q: Can I switch between Cat & Bear without restarting Rawr?\n Q: Why is the Combat Table blank for Cat?\n Q: Why are the values for most of the idols all wrong?\n Q: Can I see the values of each stat, like on Toskk's Calculator?\n A: See the \"Missing Features\" section in the ReadMe. All of these will be solved in the next major version, b11.\n\nVersion History\n---------------\nBeta 10:\n* Cat Support! When Rawr opens, you'll be given a choice of loading the Bear of Cat calculation model. Choose Cat to start using Rawr for optimizing your dps! Most of the Cat calculations are based on Toskk's cat calculator. Huge thanks to Toskk for this!\n* Rawr automatically will detect and activate set bonuses as appropriate.\n* Cat stats are now loaded from the armory, in addition to Bear stats. Only stats relevant to your current mode will be visible.\n* Procs and Uses are now averaged out for Cat, but remain off with optional buffs for Bear.\n* The calculation models are now completely modular. Rawr is very extensible now. It will be much easier to add another model now. If anyone's interested in writing Rawr.Tree, or Rawr.Moonkin, or Rawr.Afflliction, or Rawr.Mutilation or any other class/spec, let me know.\n* There's now an Options tab which contains additional options for the calculations, for both Cat and Bear. For Bear, there's only Target Level. There's much more for Cat though (although most of the Cat options aren't done yet). Currently you can change the Target Armor and choose how often you Powershift.\n* The legend on the comparison graph is gone. I hope to re-implement that at some point, but not a high priority.\n* Improved rendering of tooltips slightly.\n* Fixed a bug with the Filter box on the Item Editor.\n* Probably a dozen other little things that I can't remember cause I've been working on this for so long.",

This should solve the errors caused by intermittant Armory problems. Additionally, if it still fails, it won't close Rawr.\n * Fixed some display problems in the item editor. Also, if you add an item with an ID that doesn't exist, it'll offer to create the item as a blank item, for you to fill in.\n * Clarified the tooltip for anticrit when you're uncrittable.

It will alert you to the fact that it could not find item data for that item, and revert to the current data.",

    "Description": "Beta 6 took quite a while to develop, and I wanted to change that with Beta 7. So beta 7 hasn't taken nearly as long (about 2 weeks, I think), but I've made a multitude of improvements and new features, which I think you'll enjoy. Some of these have been requested for quite a while. Check out the version history for details.\n\nBeta 7:\n -Added Contextual Menus for items. You can now right click on an item on the main screen, in the popup item selector, to get a menu of things to do on that item:\n\t-Edit: Opens the item editor to that item.\n\t-Open in Wowhead: Opens a new web browser window and navigates to the item in wowhead.\n\t-Refresh Item Data: Refreshes the data about the item from the armory.\n\t-Equip: Equips the item.\n\t-Delete: Deletes the item from Rawr's database.\n -Implemented a ton of new temporary buffs. These buffs are typically from trinkets, or other procs, and most can't really be relied upon to base your gear selections around, but it is interesting to see your stats with these activated.\n -There are now 3 different buff comparison graphs, which let you choose which subset of all the buffs to show: All Buffs, All Long-Duration Buffs (No Dual Wield), and Current Buffs.\n -Made the buff selection tab less cramped, by splitting it into categories, and making it scroll.\n -Added a tooltip to the Chance to be Crit % on the main screen, which will display how much you're over, or under the anti-crit cap, in terms of defense rating or resilience.\n -Added a comparison graph for the Combat Table. This will display the chances of each possible combat swing outcome. If you sort by alphabetical, it will be displayed in the correct order of the combat table.\n -Added another comparison graph, which will include all of your currently equipped gear, enchants, and buffs. While not particularly useful in making gear decisions, this is interesting to look at to see where your mitigation and survival come from.\n -May have fixed the problem with tooltips appearing in the wrong spot on computers with multiple monitors.\n -Enchants in the comparison graph will be highlighted if they are the currently selected enchant for that slot.\n -Buffs will now be highlighted in the comparison graph if they are active.\n -Tooltips will now show up for enchants in the comparison graph.\n -Added a Filter box on the item editor, to make finding specific items in the list faster.\n -Fixed a bug where resilience rating wasn't properly detected on items in a few cases, mostly on gems or socket bonuses.\n -Made the comparison graph understand the concept of 'Infinity'. It will no longer bug out and be blank if any item has a mitigation or overall rating of infinity. This can occur when an item pushes you over 100% dodge.\n -Capped dodge at 100-Miss. Functionally, this doesn't really matter, since it doesn't matter how much over 100% your Miss+Dodge is, if it is over 100%, but I made the change so that it the actual chances of each occurance are correct.\n -Fixed the tab order on the item editor.\n -Fixed some display issues with item tooltip content.\n -Cleaned up the code all over the place.\n -Minor bugfixes here and there.",

Honestly there aren't a ton of new features in Beta 6, but it took me a *ton* of time to get the new tooltips and dropdown menus working properly. Beta 7 should have all the fancy new features I promised, and I really hope to have Beta 7 out much quicker than Beta 6 took. \n\nBeta 6a:\n -Fix for gem editing\n\nBeta 6: (private release)\n -Updated a few buffs for Patch 2.2\n -Implemented new ToolTips for items. While not a highly requested change (and functionally there have been no changes), it was necessary in order to implement the next item...\n -Implemented new item selection dropdowns. Instead of clicking on an item slot and getting a dropdown menu, there's now a much more feature rich popup to choose items. I fully intend to flesh this out with more features, but for now you can see what gems are in each item, see the tooltip for it, see the ratings for it, and have the list sorted by ratings/alpha. You can also type a part of the item name in the Filter box, to filter to items containing that text.\n -Added Alphabetical sorting to the graph\n -Fixed a nasty bug with the calculations for Blessing of Kings. Sorry about that. :(\n -Ugh, prolly a few other things I can't remember right now since it's been so long.",
