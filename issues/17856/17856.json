    "Description": "I have a boomkin profile and have the heroic [item]Pendant of Split Veins[/item] 264 item with a runed cardinal ruby equipped with an overall rating of 845.  RAWR puts this neck with a purified dreadstone as BIS with an overall raiting of 1285.  How does the purified dreadstone gain 440 overall points over a runed cardinal ruby?  RAWR also lists spellpower as the #1 relative stat with spirit as the least relative stat.  No idea why it would try to put spirit in there and bump the rating by such a large amount",

      "Message": "OK, actually looked at your toon and saw what the problem was. The purified does several things for you: 1) 12 SP and 10 Spirit and 2) gives you socket bonus of 5 SP so just the gems gives you 17 SP and 10 Spirit compared to a straight 23 SP. But the biggest difference you are seeing is the activation of your Meta Gem for a 21 crit rating and increase of 3% on spell crit damage.\r\nIf you have \"Enforce Gem Req.\", you should have a red box around your head piece, which is how Rawr let's you know that the meta req. are not met.\r\nSince you stated that the Purified showed 1285 vice Runed at 845, you had to have this selected else the pirified gemming would not show.",
