    "Description": "ver. 4.3.7.0\n \nWhen importing character data from Rawr addon or Battle.net, the mastery value showed in Rawr is higher than actual one. About 1 to 2 points. (In-game and Armory value, no buff).\n \nAlso, melee and spell hit, crit are inaccurate too. Haste however, is accurate.\n \nIt led to value some trinks like The Hungerer higher than Vial of Shadow, which defies the reality.",

      "Message": "The fact that Vial of Shadows is ranked low is because I have not got its damage proc counted yet (I am working on it).\r\nSpell hit is out by 0.02%, Melee hit by 6%.  The spell hit is due to rounding, while the melee hit is because I've missed the Enhance spec bonus in my last update. The rest are out by a weird amounts.  I will look into it further.",
