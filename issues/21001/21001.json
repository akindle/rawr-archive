    "Description": "I'm having issues with a few gear slots when importing Gorsh from US-Zul'jin via battle.net (Enhancement Shaman).  This is using 4.1.06.\n \nMy belt (Star Chaser Belt of the Sotrmblast) is coming through with no stats on it.  This may be understandable because the armory is showing neither the crit nor the reforge of crit to expertise.\n \nThese next two, however, are correct on the armory but not in Rawr:\n \nMy gloves are not reforged in Rawr, but armory shows they're reforged (crit to mastery).\n \nMy second ring slot (Mistral Circle of the Windstorm) is not reforged in Rawr, but armory shows they're reforged (crit to hit).",
