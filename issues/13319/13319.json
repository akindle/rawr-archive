    "Description": "Using 2.2.5 Rawr will occassionally freeze when running an optimize, and has frozen before reaching the end of the batch upgrade report all four times I've tried it so far. It stop at a different point each time, doesn't display an error, just stops progressing. It also seems to still be consuming CPU processing power and does not show as not responding in task manager. I assumed a bit of patience might help but it was on the same percentage completion ovetr an hour later. Character XML attached. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help identify the issue as I know how hard it is to find the cause of an intermittant problem.",
