    "Description": "Would be cool to be able to import your raid team from wow-heroes/armory type system in order to fill out the buffs. This would alleviate having to know which buffs every single raid member was currently equiped with. Would also be nice if rawr optimized who casts what buff on selected encounter  and reported on the calculations.",

The easier it is for a raid leader to know exactly who to tell to buff what....just seems like it would be easier imho.",
