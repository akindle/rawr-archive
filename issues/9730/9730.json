      "Message": "Just curious, why would a DPI setting other than 96 be \"broken\"? It sounds more like the application is broken if it does not operate correctly under various DPI settings. Users of Windows Vista might also be more likely to have a default system DPI setting other than 96.",

In this particular case a high resolution screen laptop that become ~unreadable when the setting in changed. Like so many windows issues the application programmers end up being the most flexible.  Thanks in advance. Great program.",
