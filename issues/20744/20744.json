In addition to the 300 Agility from this proc, between these two spells:\r\n\r\nhttp://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=99621\r\nhttp://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=99622\r\n\r\nWe can safely deduce that the physical damage ranges from 550 - 1650 damage, with a 10% chance to proc. Elitist Jerks are currently hypothesizing that the cooldown is the same as that of Gnomish X-Ray Scope, which is at a 45 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nThe proc lasts for 10 seconds.",
