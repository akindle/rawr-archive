    "Description": "Rawr 4 now requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4 full instead of client, and in fact crashes without full.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start Rawr 4.\n2. Import a character from the armory.\n \nExpected result:\nA successful importation.\n \nActual result:\ncrash\n \nThe crash has been noted in work item 19845, but the issue is more involved.\n \n \nThere is no information that Microsoft .NET Framework 4 full is required, either in the program or on the website.\n \nMicrosoft doesn't recommend the full version, they recommend the client version: \nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/jgoldb/archive/2010/04/12/what-s-new-in-net-framework-4-client-profile-rtm.aspx\n \nMost people have the client version.  It is installed with Windows 7.\n \nRawr 3 did not require the full version, so the existing user base doesn't expect to need it, and largely does not.  This is why work issue 19845 was filled, why I noticed it (and wasted a lot of time), and why duplicates were filed.\n \nThere's a couple of ways to resolve this bug:\n \n1. Remove the full version dependency.  It's probably not truly needed.  It's not recommended.  No one has it.  The existing Rawr 3 user base doesn't have it. There no documentation that it's needed or instructions where to get it.\n \n2. Add code to Rawr to check when the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 full version is missing and display a useful alert.  Then safely exit the app.  Update the web site with the needed information as well.",
