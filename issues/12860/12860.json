    "Description": "The solutions that I'm seeing from Rawr 2.2.0b5 seem to be ignoring the set bonuses from T8 mage gear.   Are these implemented yet?  They dont show up in \"Buffs | Set Bonuses\" section like the other armor set bonuses.   As such, the solutions from the optimizer are suggesting inluding 1 piece of T8 set gear (BiS), while going for offset in all the other slots.",
