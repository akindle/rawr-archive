    "Description": "Hello,\n \nI've been using rawr a lot these last few days to create a BiS item list, comparing my results with simcraft and those of other guildies. I've noticed that under the \"Buff => Set Bonuses\" menu, the Time Lord's Regalia (T13) 2 pieces Bonus is shown as 0 dps, though I have the 4 part equiped in my file. \n \nTrying to figure this out, I've tried several things.\n- I took my actual character and changed 2 items, to equip 2 part T13 and I lose the 4 part T12 without gaining the 2 part T13. I was losing a flat 800 (more or less) dps.\n- I reloaded my character from the armory and under the menu set bonuses the 2 part T13 showed its bonus dps. I did the same operation as above, equipping 2 part T13 losing the 4 part T12 with nearly no dps loss, \"gaining\" what the 2 part T13 should have been.\n- Seeing that all my saved files had the same problem, I decided to create a new one, from scratch, doing everything by hand (no armory load, etc). The 2 part T13 set bonus was showing up until I hit the optimize button, giving me an optimized item setup but losing the 2 part T13 set bonus in the menu once again.\n \nI'm using the silverlight offline version, but the online one gives me the same results.\n \nI can't seem to find how tu upload more than one file at a time. :/\nFirst *.xml (test 9 fire) is my current character.\nThe second one (test 9 fire bis) is the reloaded from armory character with the 2 part T13 set bonus.\nThe third one (fire 4.3 HM) is the optimzed setup I had, working from a \"previous file\".\nThe fourth one (fire 4.3 HM bis) is the new one I made today, from scratch, that lost the bonus after the optimizer.\n \nI'm sorry for my poor english, its not my mother tongue. :/",
