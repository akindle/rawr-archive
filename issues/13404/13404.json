    "Description": "I have to say first I love this program but, I have one problem. I loaded my char into it from the armory and checked to see if everything loaded right and it did. I ran the optimizer so far so good,I went into the game and changed my gems to what was my opimized set up. The numbers in game and what Rawr didn't match. I have both char files saved if you'd like to look them over your self.\nAny idea as to why this happened? I set my gear up just as it was in the optimized version I checked it 3 times but still no idea why the numbers don't match, I'ts my hit rating and my overall dps that I was hoping to optimize but didn't. My dps did go up a bit but my hit rating took a hit.",
