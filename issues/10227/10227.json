    "Description": "Windhawk shows up in the mage and warlock lists, even though they have no way to get the bonus.\n \nIt shows up in Retribution also.  It takes a really \"special\" Ret. to be running around with the Windhawk bonus.  Likewise, only exceptional ProtWarriors will have the Clefthoof 3-piece bonus.\n \nPerhaps Item::Type and/or RequiredClasses should be moved down to Stats?  Might be too big of a change for a relatively minor benefit.",
