This is made up of 8 Expertise from Unleashed Rage and 541 expertise rating (not including weapon racials since you are a draenei).\r\nSince I can't find you on Battle.Net, I only have your character.xml to go by.  The stats display shows you at 18 expertise (8 from UR and 327 rating).  Adding up your expertise rating from your gear manually, you are at 327 rating.  This is below the cap mentioned above.\r\nNow since I can't find you on Battle.Net, I don't know what it is saying your expertise/expertise rating should be.  So, as Jothay said, can you please be a bit more specific.",
