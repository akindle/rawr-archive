    "Description": "Every time I try and load a character, the loading bar will begin to animate, and that it hangs, and when I mouse over the loading bar, I get the following error message:\n \n \n[HtmlPage_NotEnabled]\nArguments:\nDebugging resource strings are unavailable. Often the key and arguments provide sufficient information to diagnose the problem. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=106663&Version=8.0.50106.0&File=System.Windows.Browser.dll&Key=HtmlPage_NotEnabled\n \n   at System.Windows.Browser.HtmlPage.VerifyThreadAndEnabled()\n   at System.Windows.Browser.HtmlPage.get_Window()\n   at Rawr.Silverlight.App.ProcessBookmark()\n   at Rawr.Silverlight.App.LoadFinished(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n   at Rawr.UI.LoadScreen.filesLoaded(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n   at Rawr.UI.FileUtils.DownloadIfNotExists(EventHandler callback)\n   at Rawr.UI.LoadScreen.iq_Closed(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n   at Rawr.UI.LoadScreen.LoadFiles()\n   at Rawr.UI.LoadScreen.StartLoading(EventHandler callback)\n   at Rawr.Silverlight.App.Application_Startup(Object sender, StartupEventArgs e)\n   at System.Windows.CoreInvokeHandler.InvokeEventHandler(Int32 typeIndex, Delegate handlerDelegate, Object sender, Object args)\n   at MS.Internal.JoltHelper.FireEvent(IntPtr unmanagedObj, IntPtr unmanagedObjArgs, Int32 argsTypeIndex, String eventName)\n \n \n \nI have tried characters on different realms, and I have tried the offline version as well, all with the same results. My guess is there is something wrong with my Silverlight plugin. Running on Windows 7, tried in Chrome, Firefox and IE.\n \nEdit: I just now was able to load a character I had saved from Rawr 2.3.13\nEdit 2: Once I had my character loaded, I was able to load any character of the same class (druid in my case), but I wasn't able to load my mage, or DK.",
