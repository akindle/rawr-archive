    "Description": "I was talking to a guildy earlier today about Shadow gear for ICC and I was asking him about the trinket and he says it is not that good given that it works on \"Non-Periodic\" Damage. This means VT, DP, SW:P, and Mind Flay all do not proc. I'm looking at the trinket and it is saying on \"Spell Crit.\" This means the trinket only works with SW:Death and Mind Blast. However when I'm looking at the list of trinkets, Reign of the Unliving is being values extremely high.",

This trinket proc is well worth it and exactly where it should be on the Spriest list.\r\n\r\nAlso, Improved DP is not perodic either, meaning that crit can creat a mote of flame as well. So while SW:P, VT, and the peroidic part of DP; cannot create motes, the rest can.\r\n\r\nHope this helps :)",
