    "Description": "I noticed that with my enhancement shammy (I haven't checked other toons), that on the Stats tab --> under Complex Stats -> Avoided Attacks.\n \nAvoided Attacks: 4.91\n \nHowever the tooltip shows the breakdown as:\n \n0.13% Boss Dodged\n0.00% Boss Parried\n0.00% Spell Misses\n5.05% White Misses\n \nMy guess is that it's deducting the Boss Dodged value from the White Misses but I would have been expecting it to have been added together. So instead of 4.91% I would have expected it to be 5.18%, or have I missed something?",
