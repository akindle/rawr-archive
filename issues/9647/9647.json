    "Description": "There is code written to prevent a proxy account lock out when certain HTTP errors are returned.  This was needed due to the stream of requests that typically happen when a user or item is loaded (character sheet, items on that character sheet, talents, etc.).  The prevention code was not resetting itself to check again on new user actions.  This had the side effect of, if bad proxy information was set, and the user changed their settings to correct them, it was not trying to use those new proxy settings until after the application was restarted and the lock out prevention code was reset.",
