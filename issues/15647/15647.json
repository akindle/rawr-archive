    "ClosedComment": "This problem was caused by the recent armory update.Blizzard changed the talent icons from .gif to .jpg - and reduced their size from 43x43 down to 31x31. This resulted in incorrect URL&#39;s being passed into the Rawr file downloader, which meant that talent icons could not be downloaded and saved to the talent_images cache. This also resulted in very long application startup times.Fixed in changeset 44284.",
