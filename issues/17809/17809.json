    "Description": "Recently, a new trigger has been added for correcter modeling of TAJ for retribution paladins. this trigger, MeleeAttack, according to the Documentation, was already applied to TAJ. however, either it seems like this has not yet happened, or that you need to update the trigger manually.\nÂ \non the added SS, you can see that the trigger still is the slightly outdated MeleeHit. according to the documentation for retribution paladins, however, this trigger was supposedly changed to meleeAttack. in 2.3.18, this is not the case, it seems.",

      "Message": "It was changed in 2.3.16 item parsing to use the new trigger. And it will use this trigger if you do an update from wowhead/armory.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to get updated in the default item cache as well, but apparently it hasn't.  I even pointed astrylian to the fact the item cache needs updating after the 2.3.17 release :-(\r\n\r\nTime to poke the bear again.",
