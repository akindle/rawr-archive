    "Description": "I used the armor Optimizer on on my priest and got an upgrade list...  I was curious so I looked at the upgrade list. It had only leather items listed and all the equip had agi or AP on it.  The staves listed were also melee only styled(no caster stats).\n \nSo I went to Refine types of items listed.  The only option available to check and uncheck were Leather, Staff, Polearm, 2H Mace, Relic, and Misc.  Everything else was grayed out and unselectable.  Upon further inspection, I found the Option tab reflects what it would for a Druid. (please note I loaded a Priest)\n \nI loaded my character via Character Profile.  BloodElf / Priest. Initial it was set to Shadow but I changed it to Holy ( was going to try out the new feature but its not available).  I then used the Optimize option and received an Upgrade list (with only kitty items on it).  I checked the Comparison chart, it also only listed kitty items.  And none of my gear was changed to reflect the best gear for a holy priest (Consider I do have 2 sets of gear and I was wear the dps set)\n \n \n \nSummary:",
