Latest Rawr release is 4.0.12 which was released on 19DEC10, therefore this (and other recent fixes) will not be truly fixed till the next release (in a few days, hopefully). \r\nOn another note, I recieved no errors after performing Jothay's modification. There may be other issues with the model you were using that you should search for and/or repost as necessary.",
