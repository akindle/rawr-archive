    "Description": "RAWR is acting weird. Optimizer leaves my Stinger of the flaming scorpion wand not reforged, giving me 32840 dps for my settings. I reforge the crit to haste and now it shows as 32843dps. I run the optimizer again and it still wants me to not reforge it, even though it does acknowledge it as a dps loss?\nÂ \nThis is all at max thoroughness. Char file attached.",
