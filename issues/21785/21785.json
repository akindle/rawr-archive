    "Description": "included my file with the way it should be done but as soon as you it optimize with the max thoroughness it reforge stat that should not be touched at all for frost\nÂ \nit reforge to crit when crit is the worst stat frost have since KM proc make it irrelevant with high haste\nit reforge out of haste to get mastery or crit when haste is the best stat, as more auto attack = more km procs",

      "Message": "Actually I'm suggesting that both are a possibility.  Other classes have haste plateaus, so why not DKs?  It could also be that my rotations code doesn't have enough fidelity to deal with the higher haste values as it may be showing a point where spending ALL runes and ALL RP in the rotation sets us up to be GCD capped when RE procs are at their distributed mean.  I'll see about tweaking the rotation to allow for the possibility of being RP positive if runes become available before spending all the available RP. That may change the point in which we hit that plateau.",

So have a decent sample set (at least for DW) to find some more information about KM procs and their relation to actual crits in-game, and such. I'm going to add an option to setup the KM consumption rate because I'm seeing that I consume only about 85-92% if you assume that every crit came from KM.  With that in mind, I'm going to pull natural crit out of the value for OB & FS completely.  That should really nerf the value of crit rate, and rely exclusively on Haste for KM procs and then average 90% of KM procs as crit value for OB & FS.",
