    "Description": "Simple description - a list of upgrades that can be purchased with X emblem (e.g. Triumph) and their relative value (i.e. DPS/HPS improvement) per emblem.\nÂ \nWordy description: With the new dungeon finder prpoviding near instant  dungeon access and even more emblems, there are MANY players now with vastly improved access to Triumph and Frost emblems. What's the best way to spend them for the player? Sure, you could build a quick spreadsheet with the improvement (DPS/HPS/effective health, etc) divided by the cost in emblems, resulting in a value per emblem (e.g. 100dps improvement for 50 emblems = 2.0 per emblem). The problems are that this is time consuming, AND it changes with every gear upgrade or talent change. A dynamic list pulled from the Rawr database could instantly list the upgrades by value per emblem, based on the sorting you select.",
