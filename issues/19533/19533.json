    "Description": "Hi, for some reason my wife char's are not importing into the new rawr, I've reinstalled sliverlight on her machine and eventually tried her char's on my machine and the same error happens. My chars work just fine.\n \nSome details: We are playing in eu terenas and her main char is called OuPerse. Every time we try and load her char from battle.net we get a error \"No Message\" and \"No Inner Message\", also no stack....\n \nHope any of you can help.",
