This effectively cuts a necessary row off the paper doll which allows it to compress.2&#41; Browser Zoom&#58; Ctrl&#43;MouseWheel. Silverlight is designed to resize based on your Browser&#39;s zoom settings. Putting it at 90&#37; along with CPDM &#40;above&#41; should resolve the issue.3&#41; Buy a monitor made in the last 5 years.

    "Description": "This is kind of a bug (for me anyway) and kind of a feature request I guess. But anyway: I suppose this is a result of LCD's, but for people still using CRT's it be nice if the program was a bit more compact or made more configurable so stuff like the find field would show up. At the moment it's unusable since it's smashed together into nothingness with the other buttons, though I'm pretty sure older revisions didn't do this at 1152X864.",
