    "Description": "Using Rawr 4.3.3, I am unable to activate the Enhancement T13 set 2- or 4-set bonus when equipping set pieces of any ilevel.\nÂ \nI've tried equipping RDF, Normal, and Heroic versions of all 5 pieces of Spiritwalker's Battlegear. The armor items all correctly belong to the Spiritwalker's Battlegear set, but the set does not appear to be providing any bonuses. This is resulting in the T12 heroic set being valued above most of the T13 tier by the program.",
