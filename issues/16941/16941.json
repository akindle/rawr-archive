    "Description": "When comparing identical armory loads/buffs/options on the same character, Rawr3 vs 2.3.13 shows a huge disparity in the effective DPS for Deathbringer's Will and Whispering Fanged Skull for both ilvls with Rawr3 being substantially lower.  Based on the Rawr3 DBW numbers, my theory is that the passive effect is functioning but the proc is not.\n \nMost other trinkets absolute values for DPS are in the ballpark (+/-3dps).  Needle-encrusted Scorpion is slightly higher in Rawr3 (486 vs 464).  Attached is the .xml.\n \nThanks for everything and keep up the great work.",
