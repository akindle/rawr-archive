The armory is up and can be accessed from the same pc on the same network so it is not an armory issue.\n \nError Message:\n \nThe remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden.\n \nStack Trace:\n \n   at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.EndGetResponse(IAsyncResult asyncResult)\n   at System.Net.WebClient.GetWebResponse(WebRequest request, IAsyncResult result)\n   at System.Net.WebClient.DownloadBitsResponseCallback(IAsyncResult result)\n \nSuggested Fix:\n \nNo Suggested Fix",

Your trouble shooting posting guidlines page has the following on that possibility:\r\n\r\nAre you using a Proxy (as many Corporate Environments do)? \r\nDid you enter the proxy info into Rawr (Tools > Options > Network Settings) \r\nAre you using a Domain and did you enter DOMAINNAME\\username vs just username? If you did, try the other method.\r\n\r\nHowever these menu selection no longer exist in your current build of Rawr 4.0.21 (Mar 10, 2011) [r58642]. Is there another way to do this now?\r\n",
