    "Description": "Here's the current code:\n \n// Death Knight's Anguish\nSpecialEffect primary = new SpecialEffect(Trigger.PhysicalHit, new Stats() { }, 20f, 45f, 0.10f);\nSpecialEffect secondary = new SpecialEffect(Trigger.PhysicalHit, new Stats() { CritRating = 15, }, 20f, 0f, 1f, 10);\nprimary.Stats.AddSpecialEffect(secondary);\nstats.AddSpecialEffect(primary);\n \nThis causes the trinket to become over-valued.\nThis trinket shouldn't be worth any more than a raw 150 crit dur: 20 sec, CD: 45 sec; Chance: 10%\n \nHowever, not sure how to stack this differently to make it work that way.",
