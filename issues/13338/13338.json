    "Description": "The optimzer for Rawr.Mage likes to show combinations of 2H Staffs and Offhand Items, where the Offhand Item is grayed out.   With the new optimizer results window, I quite often get no change in the gear EXCEPT for the grayed out offhand item.   How about setting the offhand item to be \"none\" instead of grayed when a two-handed weapon is selected.  I dont think swapping configuration that vary only by the disabled offhand is that useful.\nÂ \nSimilarly, when a two handed weapon is selected, showsing \"Slot: Gear .  Offhand .\" should probably also be blank, especiallly since the item order is random and all the items are listed at 0.00 value.  I would suggest either showing the actual relative value of the NOT EQUIPPED offhands so you can mark their \"<>\" as available using their relative value if a 1H was used, OR simply showing an empty list because you have a 2H weapon instead.",
