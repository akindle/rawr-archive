    "Description": "In our Guild raids we have one dps warrior with commanding presence, trouble is he runs with only 2/5 commanding presence. In rawr under commanding shout and battle shout it can either be set on or off essentially 0/5 commanding presence or 5/5 commanding presence.\nÂ \nCould a selector be put in place so you can select how many out of 5 the applying warrior has in commanding presence for the buff?",

We also need to rewrite the buffs pane in order to make this happen.\r\n\r\nSo ya, we could feasibly do it, but it's a low priority since most users won't need it and it would take some hefty work to get it done.",
