    "Description": "The attached character .xml has been run through the optimizer, this is the result, showing 1573.78 RawDPS (which is the value I'm optimizing by). By switching the gem in the blue socket in the boots to a Glowing Nightseye, thus activating the meta without needing the Staff, I can equip the Badge dagger and jump to 1597.43 RDPS, a far-from-trivial jump.",

      "Message": "Hmmm, I possibly have a similar issue.  The optimizer likes to equip a staff for me, but by switching to badge dagger and offhand can produce far superior dps.  For some reason it seems unable to recognise that the combined dps of the 1H + offhand combo is better than a staff.",

I added in [Blade of Twisted Visions] to the choice of weapons to optimise from and it choose it over the [Amani Divining Staff] correctly.  Yeah it still lists [Scryer's Blade of Focus] as being 4 dps higher than the [Blade of Twisted Visions].",
