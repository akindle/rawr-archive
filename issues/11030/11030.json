    "Description": "While not amazing by any means, the darkmoon fair card can add upwards to 23 MP5 for a non-raid geared shaman, and possibly more depending on raid buffs and elixirs/procs, I belive it is worth modeling.  Bangle, however, appears to be a detriment and may not be worth modeling, though since it follows the card partially, could probably be added after the card without much issue.",
