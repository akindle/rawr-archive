    "Description": "Rawr 2.2.0.b2 was compiled with an old version of Rawr.Tankadin/CharacterCalculationsTankadin.cs, and I'm not entirely sure how that happened. \n \nAs a result my GetCharacterDisplayCalculationValues() is inconsistent with my CharacterDisplayCalculationLabels. I have the most recent source, compile it.. and the problem isn't there. There was no source revision in the SVN that would show this problem.\n \nTechnically the problem is solved already; but the mystery remains.",
