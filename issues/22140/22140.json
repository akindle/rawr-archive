    "Description": "I have on my gear mixed Cata gems with new 4.3 gems. When i go to Optimize a box pops up and tells me my three 4.3 gems are not available and do I want to make them available. When I chose to make them available they changed all my old Cata gems to new 4.3 ones (red intellect gems mostly). The problem is here, my main red gems are to expensive to get right now in my realm and I want to keep my old ones. When I redo the gemmng pop up box to not make new ones available it changes my new ones to old ones in Optimizer. Is there a way to keep the older red gems, or any gems for that matter, as is?",
