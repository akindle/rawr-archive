    "Description": "Marking 'Maintain Scorch' it causes any spec to use Fire spells for it's primary rotation.  Thus the built in 'Arcane+Scorch' build drops several thousand dps when checking and unchecking the box (or removing/adding the first point in Improved Scorch talent with the Maintain Scorch box checked).  Checking the spell cycles shows it casting Fireball as it's primary spell.  The built in Frostbolt spec does the same (removing all the points from arcane, adding the 18 into fire to pick up improved scorch with the box checked) causes FFB to cast most.",
