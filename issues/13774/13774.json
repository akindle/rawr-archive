    "Description": "How to reproduce.\n1) Load a Retribution character. (You can load Xyrm on Bonechewer if you need one to test).\n2) Look at [Libram of Valiance] in ranged slot.\n3) Change item to have a much shorter ICD (like 20 sec)\n4) Increase fight duration by any amount in options panel.\n5) Change ICD back to the correct 45 sec.\n6) Increase fight duration again.\nÂ \nSo the first and last duration would remember the proc rate of it at a 45sec ICD. But the middle duration will use the 20sec ICD proc rate, even if the current item has a 45sec ICD.",
