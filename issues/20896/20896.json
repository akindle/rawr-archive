    "Description": "I am using the current debug/beta version since the stable build doesn't support fury. When I go to select new gems, enchants, reforging, and even gear I get immense lag and it takes anywhere from 30-60 seconds for anything to change. My Everest says rawr is using about 90% of my 6-core cpu when the above lag happens. Is this normal? Am I just an idiot? Thanks.",
