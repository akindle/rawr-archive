    "Description": "I thought I saw an issue somewhere about this already, but on search I could no longer find it.\n \nIn the forlorn search for that elusive high score I saw once and never again, I saved off some high scoring sets when I saw them. However, in going back to my main file and equipping the exact same items/enchants/gems manually, I get nowhere near the same score. The only difference between the two should be that I removed a lot of items/enchants/gems I was fairly certain were not used in that really high score I was trying to re-find.\n \nHere is the high-score file...",

If you can find other settings I changed, I'll be happy to crawl into a corner, self-flagellate, and cry.",
