    "Description": "The latest 2.3, and 3 beta, have literally unusable optimization/build upgrade list speeds for ret pallies and dps warriors, at least for me. I checked my computer by using 2.2.28 and everything works fine. I tried a prot pally and a feral kitty on 2.3 and that also works fine. Any known issue with this for ret pallies/dps warriors? Rawr3 is unusable in nearly every fashion - every button press takes forever just to update through the browser, and the optimization is just as slow.\nÂ \nPlease help! All versions of 2.2 I used religiously and I would love to continue using this awesome tool!",

      "Message": "Not sure about the ret pally issue but i've seen several comments about the DPS warrior issue saying that it has been fixed but cannot be used unless you compile your own version or until .21 gets released. With this and several other \"big and almost unusable\" issues resolved and since it's been about 3 weeks since the last release; hopefully .21 will be out soon and that Rawr3 gets its update as well.",
