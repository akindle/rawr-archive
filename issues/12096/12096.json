    "Description": "Since 2.1.4 states that it supports enhancement shamans i was a little bewildered by the stats tab showing 100% white hit with 361 hitrating and 41% crit where i got 22% ingame. \nThose values seem to reflect the values against a level 73 boss or something, since the options tab is not editable the model might just not support those level ranges?\nKind of useless that way, would be great if somebody could add that :)",
