    "Description": "I first discovered this error when attempting to swap my existing RestoSham profile to Elemental, so I could created a second profile in preparation for Progressive Optimize.  However, I get an identical error when I attempt to select Shaman>Elemental from the dropdown box in a fresh blank profile.  Once I receive this error, however I receive it, any file action after that throws another ArgNullReferenceException.  I tried New File, Open a different file, and Open the same file again.  Until rawr is restarted, no file operations are successful.  Error code follows:\n \n[Arg_NullReferenceException]\nArguments: \nDebugging resource strings are unavailable.

      "Message": "In going to the website and selecting Shaman > Elemental without doing anything else, I do not get this issue. I also know that I fixed several null references in Elemental a couple of versions ago.\r\n\r\nAre you running the offline install without having updated to 4.0.12? Because the error as reported to use shouldn't look the same as that anymore.",

Rather than repasting, I just verified it was line-for-line the same.\r\n\r\nI'm running it online in my browser, so whatever version that is.  My Silverlight updated earlier this afternoon, but I'd never tried to swap to Elemental profile prior to that update, so I can't tell you if the behavior changed.",

      "Message": "OK, so after writing all that, I decided to try a different browser (Firefox) and was surprised to see that it appeared completely different to what I'd been using.  Only then did I notice the light gray \"Rawr b4.0.12.0\" in the bottom corner.  That sent me back to Chrome, where as you can see in my screenshots, it's running on an older version (b4.0.10.0).  So that probably explains my errors, because everything works properly in Firefox.\r\n\r\nI'm very sorry for the confusion and wasting your time on the errors, but I just assumed that if I was running online from the web that I'd be automatically running the latest version available.  But that leads me to the question of why is Chrome still running the older version, if it's running online from the web?  I tried a force refresh on the page, deleted cookies, etc., and I'm still getting the older version.  Any ideas?",
