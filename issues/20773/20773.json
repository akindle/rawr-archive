    "Description": "First of all, great program. I was glad to see it's up and running when I came back to WoW. Now for the problem: when I try to save a profile for my hunter I'm getting an error\n \nI have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Version: 4.1.5.0 ==\n \n== Error Message ==\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at Rawr.Hunter.CalculationOptionsHunter.GetXml()\n   at Rawr.Character.SerializeCalculationOptions()\n   at Rawr.Character.Save(Stream stream, Boolean closeStream)\n   at Rawr.UI.MainPage.SaveCharacter(Object sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.EventRoute.InvokeHandlersImpl(Object source, RoutedEventArgs args, Boolean reRaised)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseEventImpl(DependencyObject sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem.InvokeClickAfterRender(Object arg)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.InternalRealCall(Delegate callback, Object args, Int32 numArgs)\n   at MS.Internal.Threading.ExceptionFilterHelper.TryCatchWhen(Object source, Delegate method, Object args, Int32 numArgs, Delegate catchHandler)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\n \nI would say that I've tried anything, but there were no suggested fixes. It still creates the .xml when I try to save, but there's nothing in the profile when I load that .xml.\n \nApologies if this is something easy that I'm overlooking. Thank you for any help.",
