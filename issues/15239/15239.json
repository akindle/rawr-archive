    "Description": "The patch notes for 3.3 say:\n \n\"Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to even out the amount of starting health on the various races. All races start with a standardized level of stamina, except for orcs, dwarves, and tauren who now start with 1 extra point of stamina. For each class, bonuses and penalties to all attributes have been adjusted so that each race has an equal attribute total.\"\n \nI've not seen that in the patch notes before. Our BaseStats class doesn't look like it has this \"standardized level of stamina\" we should fix this if it needs it for the 2.3 release. Does someone have the actual race/class data for what base stats each class now has in patch 3.3?",
