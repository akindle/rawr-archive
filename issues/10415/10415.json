      "Message": "bleh apparently hitting enter doesn't start a new line. first error is that the source control provider can not be found. second is that rawr.test.csproj cannot be opened because it is not supported. third is solution folders are not supported. Then it goes on to say that the silverlight.csproj cannot be opened either and pretty much anything with .csproj on it. I can get it to start up but it has 0 items in its cache to work with",

      "Message": "Those are all correct and expected; Visual C# Express doesn't include the modules for Test projects. You could install the Silverlight tools if you like, but you don't need to. Solution Folders you don't need to worry about either, those aren't used. And the codebase doesn't include an itemcache, use your own.",
