    "Description": "I belive Elemental Precision is being calculated wrong. It tells me with my current gear I have 204 hit rating when I know I only have 167. In the Item budget it also dosn't tell me I need hit rating untill I drop it down below 13%. Elemental Precision is lowering the hit cap like it should but then it also adds an extra 3% hit rating on top of it like it shouldn't.",
