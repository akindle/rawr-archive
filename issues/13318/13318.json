      "Message": "Two things here.  1) On my DPSDK Rawr definition seems to be counting the offhand weapon, even though it is greyed out, if I actually remove it my dps drops significantly. However, more importantly is that the Optimizer seems to be factoring it into its calculations.   This is a problem for me as it is adding a fang of truth into my offhand (on top of my titansteel destroyer), using its +hit to decide that I have plenty of +hit and am over the hit cap and then recommends that I change my equip/regem to lower the +hit on the rest of my gear.",

      "Message": "Not related to 13338.\r\n\r\nDKDPS simply uses (character.OffHand != null) to determine if DW is in use or not.  Since Rawr allows equipping off-hands even though the main-hand weapon is 2h, DKDPS factors in the off-hand weapon.\r\n\r\nUploaded patch dkdualwield.patch \"should\" correct this issue.  I do suggest proofreading the patch before including it because there are some changes which could probably be done in a better fashion.\r\n\r\nThere exists a separate bug in the DKDPS model: Equipping an off-hand weapon when wielding a 2h weapon will cause the Main-Hand display to show \"NaN\" for all items.  If equipping a 1h weapon for the main-hand, this is not present.  I wasn't able to find the source of this bug and my patch does not correct this.",

It doesn't seem to change their ranking relative to each other though.",
