    "Description": "I'm not sure if this applies to other models and/or meta gems as well, but the relentless earthsiege diamond meta has bugged requirements for the cat model. in the included xml, there is a purple gem in the neck, legs, and ring with a yellow in the boots. The requirement for the meta is 1 of each colored gem. Yet, the ring is vastly undervalued if you change the gem in it to a 20 strength gem for only a loss of 8 ap through the socket bonus, but is valued at nearly 100 dps less even though the net gain of ap should be higher with a 20 str gem vs the 8 ap socket bonus + a 10str/15 stam gem",
