    "Description": "I was using the optimizer to figure out what the optimal gear would be for tanking m'uru adds, and it gave real weird gear sets. I started with a blank tauren and checked most of the gear available to my current progress (4/6 sunwell). As for the optimizer, I set it to use hit rating > 70, chance to be crit < 0.4, armor mitigation to > 73%, expertise rating > 50, and optimized for avoidance %. What I got was a character with -1.1% chance to be crit with only 53% avoidance which is clearly wrong. Each time I try to tweak one of the settings for the optimizer to be more lenient, I still end up with weird results. Also, all the gear sets it ends up with have negative scores for some reason.",

      "Message": "I don't see why it cannot reach the requirements. I tried even lower requirements. I lowered the Mob level to 71 in the options. Normal raid buffs of kings, fort, mark, etc. These are very light requirements and I see no reason why not they cannot be reached. Hit rating over 60, expertise over 40, armor mitigation at least 74%, and chance to be crit less than or equal to 0. Those kinds of stats are clearly obtainable with having everything up to M'uru killed. As for the character file, I started with a completely naked Tauren character and just ticked everything I had access to. Just now using negative scored set equipped, I ran the optimizer again now dropping the requirements to 74% armor mitigation and hit rating greater than 30, and that's it with all gemmings selected and I ended up with a -30 score. \r\n\r\nI have double checked everything and all appropriate gear was checked, enchants were checked, gems were checked, raidbuffs were selected, and the mob level was set to level 71. I have to suspect something about optimizing for hitrating and/or expertise is messing with something as if I remove these from the list of requirements, everything seems fine.",

To make it fit the settings in the optimizer, I just put on a nether shadow tunic, shard of contempt over the stam trinket, badge tank ring over the badge dps ring, put on t6 belt, and T6 gloves and it worked out perfectly. All mentioned items, as you can see, are checked for the optimizer as well.",
