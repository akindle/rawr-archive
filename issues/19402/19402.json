    "Description": "I came across this issue when testing out possible heroic gear. When I import my character into Rawr I noticed that the stats where differing greatly. The attack power is off, now I'm assuming that it is automatically adding full vengeance, but it is still off by a couple thousand. I also recommend adding an initial attack power as my main concern is going to be initial threat, not when I'm full vengeance. The stamina itself is off by 3k and the hp itself is up by 8k. Looking through the code for the bear calculations I've noticed a problem with the math \n \nBonusStaminaMultiplier = (1f + 0.02f * talents.HeartOfTheWild) * (1f + 0.02f * talents.SurvivalOfTheFittest) * (1f + 0.01f * talents.ImprovedMarkOfTheWild) - 1f,\n \nNow I believe it should read as Survival of the Fittest is gone as is Improved Mark of the wild\nBonusStaminaMultiplier = (1f + 0.06f * talents.HeartOfTheWild),\n \nNow these are totally wrong and don't have a replacement as far as I'm aware\nBonusAgilityMultiplier = (1f + 0.02f * talents.SurvivalOfTheFittest) * (1f + 0.01f * talents.ImprovedMarkOfTheWild) - 1f,\n                BonusStrengthMultiplier = (1f + 0.02f * talents.SurvivalOfTheFittest) * (1f + 0.01f * talents.ImprovedMarkOfTheWild) - 1f,\nBonusAttackPowerMultiplier = 0.02f * talents.ProtectorOfThePack,\n \nNow the other main problem I've noticed is that I do not see is Armor Specialization in the bear calculations or in the buffs, this is going to throw off the calculations for all classes by a lot, this is also going to effect the math on stam.\n \nLooking over the talents I dont see any problems, the main problem is that the talents and math for the calculations have not been updated.\nI've inclued a screenshot of my doll in game for you to compare. No problems i've seen on any defence stats\n \nWhiiplash-Hyjal",

If that is the case that line is wrong and explains the problem with the stamina skyrocketing.\r\n\r\nI believe the line should read:\r\nBonusStaminaMultiplier = (1f + 0.02f * talents.HeartOfTheWild) * (leatherSpecialization ? 1.05f : 1f) - 1f\r\nwhere each addition point of HotW should give 2% bonus stamina and not 20%.\r\n\r\nI've checked myself versus in-game and it appears to be consistent.  For ease of checking here is a character file wearing no leather and having ~1000 stamina (1007).  By adding one point to HotW stamina should go up 2% to 1027 but it jumps to 1208 instead.\r\n",
