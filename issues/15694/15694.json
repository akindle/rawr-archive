    "Description": "I am running Rawr3 in mac os 10.6.\nWhen I have enforce gem requirements checked, the 264 t10 shoulders (no other shoulders that I've noticed) only display with blue gems. I have the meta requirement taken care of on my chestpiece already.\nWhen I uncheck enforce gem requirements, non-blue gem setups appear in addition to the blue ones.\nI saw something vaguely similar that was posted previously, also in enhancement, but it seems to have been closed. Sorry if this is redundant.\nxml file attached.",
