    "Description": "There are several issues with Instant Poison in rawr 2.3.12. On first glance the damage seems in the right ballpark; around 21% of total damage. However it is still lower than what I see rogues actually do. I'm comparing my guild's rogue with a recent combat log at http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/uaqeqhdqf13yu8x7/details/28/?s=1644&e=1828.\n \n- Instant Poison should use spell crit; bonus damage is 50%, not 100% like melee attacks;\n- consequently its crit chance should be based on intellect, not agility;\n- now we see instant poison damage being too low. The proc chance needs to be upped; haste does not lower PPM, so use base speed rather than hasted speed.\n \nI'm not sure these changes make Instant Poison damage 100% accurate, but they seem much closer to the actual numbers.",
