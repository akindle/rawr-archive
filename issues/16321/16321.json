    "Description": "1. Rawr treats Abomination Knuckles as a 2H weapon for the purpose of enchants.  (It's a fist weapon.)  No matter which enchants I select, it complains that I haven't chosen any, and it doesn't apply any.\n2. When I select \"Any\" under enchants, the optimizer chooses \"No Enchant\" instead of the best one.\n3. The optimizer warns me that it will assume that I have two gutbusters.  How do I tell it that I have only one?  Or for greater efficiency, how do I tell it to use the gear that I am currently wearing and optimize the enchants only?",
