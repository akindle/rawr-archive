    "Description": "So I have attached a screenshot showing the stats of my UI (Left) and the armory (middle) and then to the right is what has imported from the Battle.net using the offline version of Rawr.\n \nThe stats are a bit off and does set me off thinking I have done something wrong myself. Just want to know if this is an issue or something that rawr does with calculations.\n \nAnd for information I have my rawr set to unbuffed but it doesn't make a difference.",

I didn't change anything after I imported her from Armory. Gear, gems, and enchants are all correct. She's unbuffed in all 3. The base stats are correct, but not defensive. Help?",
