    "Description": "Two trinkets are giving negative mitigation ratings for my druid bear. The trinkets in questions are Spidersilk Spindle (both normal and heroic version) and Stay of Execution. This only seems to happen after I configure the Boss Handler (to T12 25N average boss). I have attached a screenshot and a character file to reproduce the issue. I'm using Rawr version 4.2.3.0, directly from elitistjerks.com.",

According to some of the information I read from http://theincbear.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=67 it seems that while these two trinkets are more situational based they still give instead of reverse benefits.  Does it have something to do with the absorb function not being calculated properly?",
