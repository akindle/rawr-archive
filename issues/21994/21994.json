    "Description": "Lightweave Embroidery (Rank 2) seems to not be properly evaluated.   \n \nMaybe a clue to the problem can be found in Rawr.Base -> Enchant.cs in the difference between the old Lightweave Embroidery and the new one.   The old one initializes the stats with Spirit=1 probably a workaround for some other issue.   Suggested patch is to initialize the new one in the same manner.\n \nSee snippet below ...\n \n#region Level 85 (Cataclysm)\n#region Back\n{\nenchantTemp = new Stats();\nenchantTemp.AddSpecialEffect(new SpecialEffect(Trigger.SpellCast, new Stats() { Intellect = 580 }, 15, 64, 0.25f));\ndefaultEnchants.Add(new Enchant(4115, \"Lightweave Embroidery (Rank 2)\", ItemSlot.Back, enchantTemp, \"spell_arcane_prismaticcloak\"));\n}\n{\nenchantTemp = new Stats() { Spirit = 1 };\nenchantTemp.AddSpecialEffect(new SpecialEffect(Trigger.SpellCast, new Stats() { SpellPower = 295 }, 15, 60, 0.35f));\ndefaultEnchants.Add(new Enchant(3722, \"Lightweave Embroidery\", ItemSlot.Back, enchantTemp, \"spell_arcane_prismaticcloak\"));\n}",

      "Message": "I apologize for not providing context.   For a level 85 human Shadow Priest (Tailor/Enchanter), Intellect is the top stat. While Lightweave Embroidery (Rank 2) procs Intellect, it is currently being evaluated as a zero overall contribution even through it contributes 130-ish Intellect (averaging out the 580 Intellect procs).  In comparison Greater Intellect only contributes 50 Intellect.  Even if the average Intellect is evaluated lower than what I stated above, it should be evaluated as a non-zero overall contribution.\r\n\r\nMy assertion is that it should be a top of the chart enchant - for an Int loving tailor.   Of course it only applies to a high-level Tailor, so the issue could also be something tied to rawr not recognizing that the character is a tailor.  My original thought was that the enchant entry simply had its stat info set incorrectly but it seemed to be correct.   When I noted the difference between the old enchant setup and the new one, I didn't browse the code any further.",
