    "Description": "The location of most of the gear from Heroic Cataclysm instances does not indicate that it's heroic so the current filters don't work to distinguish between regular and heroic.  If you remove the \"(?<! Heroic )\" clause from the regular and the corresponding clause from the heroic and set the item level field of the filters \"0-333\" for regular and \"334-1000\" for heroic, you'll get the proper distribution of items.",

When I check \"Dungeon\",  Helm of Numberless Shadows [346] and Helm of Numberless Shadows [316] both get added along with both versions of Willowy Crown",
