    "Description": "I downloaded and ran version 18123 source code to check out the new moonkin calculations since I saw a significant amount of changes.  I checked it all out, I enjoyed it alot more and all the numbers seem more realistic.\n \nProblem I saw, optimizer used to suck totally, it would run for hours then it would return a lower gear selection than what I already had equipped (this is b13.1).  Now it actually returned a better gear selection, it matched my hit rating to 16.04% also which is good, but it ignored metagem requirements.  It selected the best possible head and best meta for it, then it didnt put any blue gems in any of my gear so the meta wasnt active.  I did have enforce meta requirements checked BTW.\n \nDunno if this is possible to fix before b14 or not, but I cant wait for it to go live!!!",

      "Message": "I can probably fix it, as the \"meta gem requirement\" bit is in every module and I'm assuming the required change must be trivial.  It's just a matter of finding it.  Glad to know that it optimized properly - given how steep hit rating is valued up to the hit cap, I was a little worried that it'd go overboard on the optimization and give you, like, 20% hit or something.",
