      "Message": "Ok, so I got it reading the Arena Point cost from Armory Refreshes on items that have to be purchased with both Honor and Arena Points. For example, \"Deadly Gladiator's Plate Helm\" (Warrior PvP Item) now refreshes it's source to \"Purchasable for 12000 Honor Points and 350 Arena Points\".\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, the Armory puts the source for the Relentless version of the same helm as a Vendor drop, instead of as a PvP Token map. I'm assuming this is the same issue for all Relentless Gear.\r\n\r\nI'm still working on getting the \"Required Arena Rating\" value to come into it. One thing to note on that is PvP Items which can be purchased with badges (like the Furious ones can be purchased with like 75 Triumphs per) the Arena Requirement isn't necessary to be fulfilled to wear the gear. Which in my opinion makes the item better than if you had purchased it with actual PvP points.",
