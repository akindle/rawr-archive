    "Description": "My character is \"Eldorann\" on Antonidas. I should be logged out in my DPS set. Now to the question.\n \nRawr rates my damage in my DPS set at 8124. That's with 2pT9 / 2pT10.  When I change it to 4pT10, my DPS drops to 7721, a significant difference. My question is then: Is this normal? My desire is a 4pT10 set that outperforms any previous gear set. (I mean for Balance.) \n \nAsking such seemingly simplistic questions helped to uncover a bug in calculating the buffs from \"Idol of the Lunar Eclipse\". Perhaps the T10 calcs need adjusting. Thank you for your time.",

      "Message": "Please post character file to assist in isolating potential problems anytime you create an issue. That being said, most 2pc bonuses are better DPS gains over the additional 2 pieces needed for the 4pc bonus. Just look under Buffs>Set Bonuses and you'll see 2pc bonus outrating 4pc bonus. However the higher stats and rating bounses of the other two pieces can often overcome these differences.\r\nFor example, 2pT10 (head and chest) gives 300dps gain and 2pT9 (hands and legs) gives 250dps gain; now you replace hands with T10 and gain 25dps and legs with T10 for another 25dps but this also gives you the 4pT10 bonus of 150dps. therefore 2pT9/2pT10 gives you 550dps while straight 4pT10 would only give you 500dps. As the individual pieces differ in potential dps gain so does the overall effect.\r\nAlso remember that not all tier gear is equivalent meaning the dps gain of a single peice is probably not going to be identical to another piece of the same level; such as dps gain from head or chest is usually much better than the hands (and usually cost more too).",
