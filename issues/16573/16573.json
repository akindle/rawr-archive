In the comparison pane under Buffs -> Set Bonuses, the only ones I see are Aegis Plate 4 piece bonus, Aegis Plate 2 piece bonus, and Redemption Plate 2 piece bonus, and it doesn't seem to place more value on a set piece when you are already wearing other items in that set.  I will attach my character file in case it's something I'm doing wrong, but it seems to work for my hunter and my wife's mage.",
