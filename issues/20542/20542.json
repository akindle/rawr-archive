I don't know...but I do know you could use a bit of patience and kindness when replying to users who just want Rawr working -which btw, I would take it as a compliment that my program is really cool instead of getting easily annoyed-\r\n\r\nSo, that's pretty much it, tanks to Timetodance who seems to be the one coming to the rescue of those of us \"who don't know how to search before posting\"...or maybe we just don't do this as a living, and actually use wow and rawr to unwind from our \"real lives\" so we apparently become a bit annoying 'cause of our \"noobness\"\r\n\r\nRegards from Argentina\r\n",
