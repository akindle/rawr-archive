When you have Enforce Gem Requirements set and try to equip more than 3 JC gems &#40;which is what that drop-down thinks you are doing, even though we know you really aren&#39;t&#41; they are ALL disabled in stats. Same goes for Nightmare Tear.To fix it, turn off Enforce Gem Requirements while you are adding your templates, then turn it back on after you are done.",

    "Description": "When accessing the gemming templates (custom gemming), it will not correctly sort the JC only gems. In fact, they are listed at the bottom of the drop down list (when an empty custom gem \"box\" is clicked) with no stats. Note: I am a JC and my filters are set correctly (gems and JC BoP under gems both checked, \"disable BoP JCing\" is unchecked). Many versions ago this worked correctly, but as of the last 5 or 6 versions this is inop.",

      "Message": "I am using version 2.3.5 and have attached my Rawr char XML. The issue is not to do with having the gems equipped or not, but rather that it will not let me add JC gems to any custom gemming template as it had in the past. To specify: I go to the TOOLS > Edit gemming Templates  then under custom I hit \"add\". In the blank box under the red column (it should work for any of them but to make this simple lets just stick with the red column) I should be able to click on it and see a list of all gems in the order that will increase my overall DPS (becasue it is sorted for overall). So the first gem that should be listed there is the BOLD DRAGON's EYE, but it is not. In fact, all the JC only gems are at the bottom of the sorted list and if I go all the way down there and look at the BOLD DRAGON's EYE (or any of them) they do not show STATS. Therefore, I can not add any of the JC only gems or the Nightmare tear to my \"custom\" gemming template. I hope that descrip was better then my first.\r\nKarasiros\r\nRealm: Quel'dorei",
