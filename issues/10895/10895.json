    "Description": "It takes into account the set bonus for spellstrike even though i do not have tailoring any longer.  when i try to uncheck the set bonus under the buffs tab it is greyed out.  This is throwing off some of the gear that would be upgrades for me, but because it is including the set bonus is actually putting it lower.  A fix for this would be appreciated.  thanks for all you guys do!",
