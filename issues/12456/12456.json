    "Description": "I've noticed over the past few versions, that when I load a saved character on a different install of Rawr (such as opening a character I saved at work on my home install), neither the model setting, nor the filter settings I had when I saved the character are loaded. By default, my Tree will always load as a \"Bear\" model on a new install of Rawr, and the filter settings never get carried over. This happens whether or not the file was saved under the same version of Rawr as it's being loaded under.\n \nIt seems logical to me that these settings should get saved along with the character data file.",

      "Message": "Fair enough, but why not save the enabled/disabled status with the character? My Druid in an Inscriber, so he may want the \"Inscription\" filter enabled, while my Mage (a Tailor) would want the \"Tailoring\" filter instead. Different toons may have access to different levels of gear as well, so my freshly minted 80 may want to see his most immediate upgrades, and thus not want \"Raids\" or \"Heroic Badges\" enabled, while my Naxx-level toon may.",

Each time I'm opening my Tankadin it applies the Healadin model. A little click to change it again, but annoying.  Would be great if you could consider saving the used model with the char data.",
