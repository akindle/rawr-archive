    "Description": "I don't know if this is specific to enh shamans, or whether it is an issue with weapon data or what.  My character, (Revirginator, Undermine) has two 2.6 speed weapons, and 472 haste rating.  With no raid buffs, the haste tooltip reports 4.77% haste instead of the 3.69% reported by WoW (not too far off), and the weapon speed is 1.80 instead of 2.51 (really far off).  This is causing flametongue attacks (and therefore spellpower) to be over-weighted in the calculations.\nÂ \nThanks for all the work you folks have put into this tool.  I have used it extensively in the past, and look forward to using it in the future.",

      "Message": "I had looked in the past at having two haste ratings for the Enhance model and now that WoW shows stats this is an even better idea.\r\n\r\nBasically its a really good idea to have all the stats now showing as they are in game on the sheet. If for no other reason than it gives you as a model developer a strong lead to see if any stats are wrong.\r\n\r\nIf I was revising the model I'd break apart the stats into in game ones and calculated ones and re-do the display tab. If you need assistance on how this should work let me know and I'll be happy to discuss it with you.",

I will double check the calcs though.  Also, the 4.77 v 3.69% haste is something else I will look into.",

So I'm still unclear about the 4.77% haste, but I'd say this is pretty low-priority if it's just a tooltip issue.  Sorry for whatever effort my confusion cost you.",

I know you were plaanning to do that anyway but conformity is win :) Check DPSWarr for an example of what I mean.",
