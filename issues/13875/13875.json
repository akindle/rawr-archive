      "Message": "Ok I found the problem you're having. You currently have 3 Kirin Tor pieces and 1 Frostfire. So for the head piece it is choosing between 4 piece T8 and 2 piece T7 bonus. Problem is that you don't have any buffs selected which makes you very mana starved, this is why it prefers the mana gem bonus. The solution is to select the appropriate raid buffs.",
