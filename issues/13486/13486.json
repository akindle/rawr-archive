      "Message": "Found this on wowwiki via Tankspot:\r\n\r\nWhen you parry an attack, the remaining time on your current swing is reduced by 40% of your weapon speed, unless this would result in a reduction to less than 20% of your swing time remaining\r\n\r\nThis results in an average of .24 extra swings per parry; thus parry favors slower, higher damage weapons.\r\n\r\nTo implement any sort of mitigation through expertise, the rotation system will definitely need to be finalized. But just throwing numbers out, assuming a fight with 100 melee swings by the player, and the suggested boss parry of 14%, 14 of those swings will result in parries, or, according to Tankspot, 3.36 more swings, or 3.36% more hits on the player. As 56 expertise is needed to not be parried, each point in expertise would then result 0.06% chance of not being hit.\r\n\r\nI know these numbers are just sort of math off the top of my head, and I'm not sure how or if other modules implement expertise, but it hope it is at least somewhat useful.",

      "Message": "One error in my math: 3.36% of the player's swings result in damage done back to them, not 3.36% more attacks by the boss. Once the rotation system is in place it should be a relatively simple addition to the stat. Something along the lines of:\r\n\r\nMelee Instants * (3.36%-(0.06%*Expertise)) + Swing Speed * (3.36%-(0.06%*Expertise))\r\n\r\nHonestly I have no idea how accurate this is in reality though.",

      "Message": "On the same line of reasoning, our own parry should be more than mitigation, as each parry will increase our total amount of swings such that there is some increased amount of threat.\r\n\r\nSorry for the multiple rapid postings, just getting things out as they come.",

      "Message": "Ok... Got some basic stats involved for expertise and white swings and WOW what a difference.  I hope that my numbers are reasonably accurate, because the math looks correct. \r\nI'll start integrating the other shots into the shot counter and such as well, but here's what the code looks like:\r\n\r\nfloat fBossShotCount = fGlobalCDTime / opts.BossAttackSpeed;\r\n// How fast is a hasted shot? 40% faster.\r\nfloat fBossParryHastedSpeed = opts.BossAttackSpeed * (1f - .4f);\r\nfloat fCharacterShotCount = 0f;\r\nif (character.MainHand != null)\r\n  fCharacterShotCount += (fGlobalCDTime / ct.MH.hastedSpeed);\r\nif (character.OffHand != null)\r\n  fCharacterShotCount += (fGlobalCDTime / ct.OH.hastedSpeed);\r\n// The number of shots taken * the chance to be parried.\r\n// Ensure that this value doesn't go over 100%\r\nfloat fShotsParried = Math.Min(1f, calcs.TargetParry * fCharacterShotCount);\r\n// How much damage per shot normal shot?\r\nfloat fPerShotPhysical = fIncPhysicalDamage / fBossShotCount;\r\n// How many shots parried * how fast that is.  is what % of the total GCD we're talking about.\r\nfloat fTimeHasted = fShotsParried * fBossParryHastedSpeed;\r\nfloat fTimeNormal = fGlobalCDTime - fTimeHasted;\r\n// Update the shot count w/ the new # of normal shots + the number of hasted shots.\r\nfBossShotCount = (fTimeNormal / opts.BossAttackSpeed) + fShotsParried;\r\nfIncPhysicalDamage = fPerShotPhysical * fBossShotCount;\r\n\r\nI know the whole model needs some more tweaking, but this code snippet for getting the mitigation value of expertise pushes expertise up the Relative Stat Values quite a bit.  I'll be checking in the change in just a bit.",
