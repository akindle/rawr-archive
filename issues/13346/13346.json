It looks corrected here but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.\r\n\r\nMy patch removes the unused GreatnessProc method from StatsSpecialEffects and replaces the class-level fields with arguments supplied to the getSpecialEffects method.  If both my patch and my analysis of the class are valid, it looks like it may make sense to move getSpecialEffects into CalculationsDPSDK and remove the StatsSpecialEffects classes.",
