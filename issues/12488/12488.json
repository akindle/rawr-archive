    "Description": "My 78 moonkin is currently wearing a Cloak of Azure Lights (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/26/star-trek-creator-and-wif_n_161118.html). What is weird is how the moonkin model is reporting values of:\n \n19.74 total item value\n18.43 damage\n1.31 raw damage\n \nOnly 1.31 raw damage? I'm using the default values from the moonkin model, almost fully talented balance. That cloak has 35 spell power and 21 intellect. Whereas another cloak with only 29 spell power and 21 intellect shows 15.19 in raw damage in Rawr. Then I noticed the pattern: my cloak also has 29 haste rating, and it seems that all cloaks with haste rating show a much lower raw damage than other cloaks with similar SP + intellect but with no haste rating.\n \nMy understanding was that raw damage was the pure contribution to damage, regardless of the fight duration. Why then is haste rating messing up my raw damage numbers?\n \nSimply load any moonkin in rawr (you can use me, Shalansay on Echo isles), select the moonkin model, show all the back/cloak items and you'll see it. I noticed this issue with both 2.1.6 and 2.1.8.\n \nIf this is a configuration issue, please let me know what I need to change to properly compare my caster cloaks with haste with others with non-haste when choosing the best. If it's a bug, then I would like to see it confirmed and hopefully addressed in the future.\n \nThanks and keep up the good work, Rawr is awesome!\n \nShalansay of Echo Isles\nLevel 78 Balance Druid",
