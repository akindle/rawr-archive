      "Message": "I assume the problem is that the special effects handling in the bear model, does not evaluate bonus armor.\r\n\r\nEasy work around is to edit the item and add 5152/6=859 bonus armor to basic stats of the item. You can then delete the special effect of the item, to prevent the chance of double effect after this has been fixed. (Reloading from wowhead or armory will replace your custom bonus armor and recreate the special effect, if you ever want to undo the change). \r\n(This is more difficult if it is a proc effect, instead of a use effect, since you first need to estimate the proc rate/uptime and possibly tweak it as your stats change).",
