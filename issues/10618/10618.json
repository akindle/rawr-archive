      "Message": "This is taking a while. It'll probably take a complete upgrade of the lp solver for this one to compute in reasonable time. I'm about 2/3 through the upgrade, but it probably won't be ready for b15.",

      "Message": "Just an update on the progress. The solver upgrade is mainly complete and it's finally able to solve the problem in under a minute. Still quite a big number, but this partical problem is the hardest I've seen so far. It needs the SMP computation limit to be set a bit over 1000 to solve it. As a comparison most other problems even with pot/gem/flamecap constraints are solved in about 1-2 seconds. I'll work a bit more on this to see if I can squeeze any more performance out of it and if I'm satisfied with the results I might check it in for the b15 release.",
