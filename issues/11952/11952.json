    "Description": "Since gem sockets can be added to items, this should be reflected in the options for gems on items, which also gives colour count to a Meta gem requirement.\n \nTypically \nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?item=41611\nand others for BS\n \nGuess it will be theoretically possible to have a 4th socket on chest items, if they at some point allow sockets to be added to chest items, while Rawr supports 3 at this time.\n--\nWhen loading a Belt item from Armory with an extra socket, the extra socket gem is added to Gems, but Sockets will say None in the drop down if you go into Edit mode on the loaded item.\n \nAny existing socket bonus you have from matching the original item sockets is also greyed out after such a load from Armory with items containing added sockets.",
