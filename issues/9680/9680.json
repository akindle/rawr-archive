    "Description": "If you click on a inventory item too quickly, the whole app crashes.  More specifically if you just changed one setting and then attemp to change something else, before it has recomputed everything(a few seconds), the applacation will become unresponsive and will terminate within 10-30 seconds.\nÂ \nThis probably means there are missing mutexes or other interlocks between the computation and UI elements.",
