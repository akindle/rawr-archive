    "Description": "I get the following error when I try to load up Rawr on my workplace machine:\n \n\"Rawr.exe - Application Error\nThe application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000135). Click on OK to terminate the application.\"\n \nI am running Windows XP Pro SP2 on a machine with an Intel Celeron 1.8 Ghz CPU and 512MB of memory. I do not experience this at home on my XP machine running a Core2Duo w/close to 3 GB of RAM. When I check my Event Viewer and get details on the error, it provides me with the following:\n \n\"Product: Windows Operating System \nID: 26 \nSource: Application Popup \nVersion: 5.0 \nSymbolic Name: status_log_hard_error \nMessage: Unable to Load Device Driver : device driver could not be loaded. \n    \nExplanation \nThe program could not load a driver because the program user doesn't have sufficient privileges to access the driver or because the drive is missing or corrupt.\n \n    \nUser Action \nTo correct this problem:\n \nReinstall the program to restore the driver to the correct location.\"\n \nWhat drivers could Rawr possibly need? I have integrated video and audio solutions, but nothing fancy as this a self-made barebones workstation at my office. I have tried compatibility modes, but I am otherwise at a loss.",

      "Message": "Nevermind, I'm a bit of a goof. I forgot that this machine was loaded completely clean, and as such did not have .NET Framework updated. Sorry!\r\n\r\nThat said, could a graceful error be added to the beginning in a future release that notifies someone they need to update/install the proper version? Might save some redundancy.\r\n\r\nI'm going to go RTFM now.",
