Both of these provide a very large amount of mana return and are very good trinkets for both entry and late raiding.",

(Can it proc while you still have the buff?)\r\n\r\nWowhead suggests Bangle of Endless Blessings has a 10% proc-rate and a 45 second internal cooldown - is this accurate?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe items should be easy enough to model on their own. The hard thing is removing the mp5 that the bangle gives while the darkmoon card has already proced.",
