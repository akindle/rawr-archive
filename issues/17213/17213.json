    "Description": "Would it be possible to develop some kind of tool, either stand-alone or incorporated into Rawr, that could analyze your real raid performance, and make suggestions or tell you what you did wrong?\nÂ \nRawr already figures out your rotation.  For example, in the shadow priest module, it tells you your cast order.  If you could point it to your raid log, it could just look through that log for the name of the character you currently have loaded, and then tell you how much that deviates from the suggested optimized rotation.",
