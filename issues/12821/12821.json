    "Description": "The \"Relative Stat Values\" for the Tree of Life model has Spirit and MP5 reversed.  It's currently showing me MP5 with a value of over 2 while spirit is around the .15 range.  If I flip those relative stat values and apply them to an item, I get the proper output (ie apply all normal relative stat values to an item, use the 2+ value for spirit, I see the actuall value Rawr has for that weapon).",

      "Message": "2.1.8, is way old, when it comes to the Tree model. :-)\r\n\r\nThe fact that the relative stats value of spirit shows both burst healing and sustained healing value, tells me that for my character and fight settings they aren't swapped around (but I never use the view, so am not sure if you found a bug that only shows up in certain situations).\r\n\r\nDo you still see the same concern with later versions?\r\n",
