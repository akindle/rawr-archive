    "Description": "I downloaded Silverlight from the link on the EJ page and then restarted the browser, but I can't get the Rawr GUI to load.  I get the Silverlight progress indicator, but it gets to 100% and never goes beyond that.  I searched the issue tracker and tried the suggested fixes for anything related I could find, ie clearing cache etc, but none have been successful.  I've tried Firefox, IE , and Chrome (on Windows XP), but no luck.  I've never used Silverlight, so I'm not sure what to troubleshoot beyond what I could find in the tracker.  Any suggestions are appreciated.",
