    "Description": "Should they? When I load my character from the armory, set all the buffs in Rawr to match what I can use solo, then apply those buffs in-game, I'm seeing some fairly substantial differences. For example, health is about 3k too high in Rawr and mana is about 2k too low. Is this normal or am I missing something?\nÂ \nAlso the scroll buffs (agility, strength, stamina, protection) are mutually exclusive but more than one can be selected in the UI.",

      "Message": "The \"Base Stats\" I'm referring to are those listed near the top of the Stats tab in Rawr in a group box labeled \"Base Stats.\"  Those change if I change a buff on the Buffs tab that affects those listed stats.  So I assumed that those \"Base Stats\" were intended to reflect the buff state (as selected on the Buffs tab).  At least that's what they appear to do for me.  I don't see a \"Unbuffed Stats\" or \"Buffed Stats\" section.\r\n\r\nThe buffs I selected on the Buffs tab are those from the attached character and accurately reflect the talents for the character (that should be verifiable from the Talents tab), the spells (Devotion Aura, Blessing of Sanctuary) and consumables (Scroll of Strength VIII, Dragonfin Filet, Drums of Forgotten Kings, Drums of the Wild, Runescroll of Fortitude, Elixir of Mighty Defense, Guru's Elixir) I use.\r\n\r\nUnbuffed, my character has these values (parentheses for Rawr values as shown in \"Base Stats\" group box, with all buffs disabled):\r\n\r\nHealth: 37574 (37594, +20)\r\nMana: 5869 (5869, +0)\r\nStrength: 1360 (1356, -4)\r\nAgility: 128 (128, +0)\r\nStamina: 3082 (3084, +2)\r\nIntellect: 117 (117, +0)\r\n\r\nSo, pretty close.  Stamina and strength off by a bit, but not much.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the buffs described above (and as indicated in the attached character file), both in-game and on the Buffs tab, the values are:\r\n\r\nHealth: 43834 (46824, +2990)\r\nMana: 6724 (6724, +0)\r\nStrength: 1657 (1785, +128)\r\nAgility: 185 (198, +13)\r\nStamina: 3708 (4007, +299)\r\nIntellect: 174 (174, +0)\r\n\r\nThanks Jothay, I appreciate your time looking at this.\r\n",

The 8% from one doesn't stack with the 10% from the other (10% should be overriding). Which is something we should fix.",

      "Message": "To the 'doesn't stack' point, I don't know if this behavior is by design or a bug, but if either Blessing of Sanctuary or Drums of the Forgotten Kings is up, trying to cast/use the other is a total no-op (disregarding the party/raid effects of Forgotten Kings).  So while you might expect that with BoS up you'd still get the 8% boost to agility, int, and spirit by using Forgotten Kings, you do not.  Likewise, if Forgotten Kings is up, casting BoS does not take your strength and stamina buff from 8% to 10%--it does nothing.  First one wins.  It may be worth considering making those buffs mutually exclusive on the Buffs tab.",

I'm not sure what circumstances the bug is reproduced under, but this is a WoW bug, as indicated here: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=12947094658&sid=1\r\n\r\nWith that said, Rawr currently does this:\r\n\r\nBoth BoS & DoFK: 18% sta, 18% str, 8% agi, 8% int, 8% spi, reduction in damage per hit, energy gain on avoid\r\n\r\nThis is definitely incorrect, as 18% sta and str is too much.  So, what I'm going to do is add a Str/Sta bonus for drums of forgotten kings.  What you'll need to do is check \"Drums of Forgotten Kings\", \"Greater Blessing of Sanctuary\", and \"Greater Blessing of Sanctuary (Str/Sta Bonus)\" to get what you want.  People not using GBoSanctuary or GBoKings can check \"Drums of Forgotten Kings\" and \"Drums of Forgotten Kings (Str/Sta Bonus)\".\r\n\r\nAlso, I find it interesting that your in game stats represent 10% sta and str, but only 8% agi int and spi.  It's as if you checked this before the bug was in, or you managed to get both BoS and DoFK on at the same time despite the bug.  Might be worth playing around with to see how to get those two up together.",
