    "Description": "I imagine that this is due to the gems filter being changed to disabling rather than enabling, but all the gems disappear now if you deselect the \"other\" filter.   Previously, the gems were unaffected by any of the filters except the specific gems filters so i'm not sure if this is intentional or not.   It is easily worked around so it isn't a big deal, but with the amount of posts here with the gems being defaulted to off in the last version, I would imagine that you will see some confused posts here.",
