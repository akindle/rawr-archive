    "Description": "http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=81314\n \nI used the exact settings Gwin used from his screenshot.  Note the attached file is using the same item cache from from http://rawr.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=15958 with the same criteria (i.e. I use Aldrianna's data for the ring proc, etc.  See that issue for more detail.  It is somewhat irrelevant to whether or not the optimization is working, however, since I am not changing caches when I manually optimize).\n \nI show 12441 DPS in this file.  This is, without any avoidance requirement, the best I can get the optimizer to return.  I've spent many hours playing with pieces by hand trying to do better and always failed.\n \nRepeated optimizes from this file with the added avoided attacks requirement exactly per Gwin never gets above ~12340.  It's often much lower.  Sometimes the final set ends up being under cap, sometimes way over.  Successive optimizations, accept gear, and re-optimize in fact tend to get worse or just bounce back and forth.  This seemed pretty good to me at first but it felt like I could do better.  I was right.\n \nPath I took to get to optimal gear, rather simple changes really:\n - Reload original file\n - Swap gems in boots to 20hit and 10hit10exp\n - Swap Frostblood ring with Band of the Bone Collosus with ArP gem\n \nI'm now at cap but enchants are not longer optimal:\n - Swap to Mongoose\n - Swap to Agi on cloak\n \nDPS 12415.  Very close to the non-hit capped optimal really.\n \nYou see a lot of obviously non-optimal choices in a lot of the gear sets it picks.  For example it sometimes will slot a 20exp gem and 2x10agi10hit gems when it is clearly more optimal to use a 20ArP and 2x10hit10exp and manually adjusting that does yield higher DPS.  These sorts of obvious \"bad calls\" are a big part of why I decided to do it by hand.",
