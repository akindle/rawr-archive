      "Message": "When comparing the worksheet (EJ 92 PTRv2) and Rawr Hunter module 2.2.17. The worksheet comes out with the same pet damage as Rawr but shows about 300 higher hunter dps (3712 vs 3423). Most of this seems to be related to the piercing shot. If I remove my 3 Piercing Shot talent points in the worksheet the difference is much lower. (3479 vs 3423).\r\n\r\nThe worksheet shows 255 added DPS for the Piercing shots at the Calculation Tab.",

The function would then add the X% to the crit damage depending on the value of the talent.\r\n\r\nI don't know if the bleed effects stack or not, i.e. if the bleed effect from an earlier crit shot stays or is overwritten if a new Aimed, Steady or Chimera shot crits within the 8 seconds. If it is overwritten it would make calculations trickier.",
