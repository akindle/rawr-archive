    "Description": "In the Buffs tab there are lots of things to be selected. Could you make a button for unselecting all?\nAnother step following that, would be select all, but thats a lot more effort and char specific.\n<Select none>\n<Select all>  to select the best to have buffs or the ones most expected or the best ones you can apply by yourself. As you can see this has some thinking points.",
