      "Message": "I'm assuming he is looking at optimising hit rating/expertise.  \r\n\r\nHaving a rating of landed attacks available, might help, but if you reach 100%, you cannot go past that, so you still want to optimise dps essentially.\r\n\r\nWhat I do is add an additional constraint of Avoided Attacks% <= 1 and then optimise DPS like normal. Then have a look at the resulting Avoided Attacks. If it is much lower than the initial constraint value, you can decide to lower it and rerun again. (If you initially go with <= 0,  and your gear doesn't have many hit available, it might be impossible to reach a valid gear combo.)\r\n\r\n",

    {
      "Message": "\"that's an odd stat to Optimise...\"   Yes, I agree, I can't think of a situation in which I'd use this for real, I'd be more likely to optimise something else, like DPS, and add an additional constraint.  What I was doing was musing idly about how far I'd be from the hit and expertise caps if I ignored everything else... and there was an optimiser drop-down for this so I thought why not see what happens.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was that it selected a lot of resto gear to put me as far from the hit and expertise caps as it possibly could.  That's exactly backwards.  I agree with you that I can see only small value in having that drop-down setting minimise avoided attacks.  I can see no point at all in having an optimiser setting that maximises your chance to not land damage on a boss... you might as well remove it altogether.",

Models provide a list of calculations that the optimizer can use and it shows those options for both optimization and constraints. I guess we could require models to provide a separate list for optimization and constraints, but I don't think it's necessary.",
