      "Message": "I'm going to close this one as well, but a bit of a heads up:\r\nOn Rawr's website, we have a section called posting guidelines.  A link to it is in large writing on the discussions page, as well as on the Rawr Online page.  The purpose of these guidelines is to make the volunteer developers' time easier.\r\nIn these guidelines it mentions to search for existing issues of your problem before you post a new issue.  The reason why Jothay got a tad frustrated and \"swore\", was because this was (I think) the 10th duplicate that he had to close within a short period of time.  What I mean by duplicate, is that it was an issue post that was exactly the same issue as an already open (not-closed) issue.\r\nSo, to sum it up:  Follow the Posting Guidelines.  This will make both our lives easier, without the foul language.",
