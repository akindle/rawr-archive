      "Message": "I think this is a simple case of misunderstanding and mis-communication.\r\n@cjbard- I opened the file you attached and looked at the trinket list. You are correct in that that list includes several JC/Alch/Eng trinkets such as figurines (serpent,owl,hare), Alchem. stones (Mighty & Mercurial), Enginneering (Noise Machine/Lightning Gen) (BTW these are the specifics Astry was asking for). I then looked at your filters from the attached file but contrary to your claim, the \"Crafted\" checkbox IS selected and therefore allowing crafted items (both BoP and BoE) to be listed. Unchecking the box causes ALL of these items to disappear from the list (as expected).\r\nIf by chance you were trying to filter out the crafted BoP trinkets, you can go further down the filter list and check the \"Disable BoP Crafted\" which removes all items except the Noise Machine (since it is BoE).\r\nAs for Shadowmourne, it is not listed under Main Hand for your posted character and i failed to get Shadowmourne to ever show up regardless of which filters were selected or deselected (which is actually a success since your a shaman).\r\nEverything you mentioned in the OP is working as intented with your attached toon and therefore unrepeatable to others. If you are still having problems, I suggest you restart your toon from scratch using Character Profiler and/or Armoury. If still having the issue, try a fresh download. \r\n\r\n@Binkenstein-Hinalover's comment applies to you. The items are listed in the posted toon for the shoulder slots but immediately are removed by deselecting the \"Armor Tokens\" box.",

      "Message": "OK I have the same issue and from reading the post in discussions I believe\r\na lot of other people are as well. I would like to point out that I think that rawr\r\nis a very valuable tool and so would like to help as much as possible in order that we\r\ncan resolve this problem fully.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would like to tell you a little about how I use rawr. As a new user the only\r\nfeature I use at the moment is the comparisions pane. If I need to upgrade a piece of gear\r\nI simply select the gear slot from the drop down menu in the comparisions pane and go for \r\nthe top gear item on the list. Enchanted and gemmed as suggested by the pop up box when\r\nmousing over the item name.\r\n\r\nHere is what I have found. If I use the filter menu in the comparisions pane to filter out\r\nany category of items I am uneligble for, or just not interested in, occasionally the top\r\nitem on the list will be an item I would expect to have been filtered out.\r\n\r\nMy example: I need to gear my recently dual speced lvl 77 resto shaman for raiding 5man\r\nheroics.\r\n\r\nMy process:\r\nI imported my character from the armoury.\r\nI selected resto from the drop down menu in the stats pane.\r\nI deselected the following:\r\n*any 5man normal dungeon I am not yet eligable for due to lvl\r\n*all heroic dungeons\r\n*all tier 7 raids\r\n*all tier 8 raids\r\n*all tier 9 raids\r\n*all tier 10 raids\r\n*all VOA\r\n*all Onyxia's Lair\r\n*all Ruby sanctum\r\n*all special currency\r\n*all pvp\r\n*all disable BOP crafted\r\n\r\nAt this point, I have just learned while writing this that deselecting BOE (possible AH) will\r\nfilter out most of the unwanted items that are labled as drops from 25man raids etc. However\r\nI am still left with items that are quest rewards from higher level quests. Perhaps an\r\nextra filter could be added in this category? I understand there is an item filter editor\r\nbut I find it a bit too complicated to use at the moment. Specifically how to add the categories\r\nto filter out and how to set a max item lvl that relates to the lvl at which it becomes\r\nequipable and not the actual item lvl. Perhaps a tutorial video on this feature would be beneficial?\r\n\r\nI will have a look on the website to see if there is any further help available on this feature\r\nand I will test this method on my other characters soon just to make sure no other unwanted items\r\nare still showing and let you know the result. It could be that a help article that explains \r\nwhat the categories include is all that is needed as now I am no longer sure if this is actually\r\na bug or just lack of user knowledge. It just shows how making yourself follow your\r\nown method step by step can resolve at a lot of problems :P\r\n\r\nHopes this helps anyone who was having the same issue\r\n\r\n- Kim x\r\n",

      "Message": "@Boo - Maybe the easiest and quickest way for you to filter the other items by their iLevel vice the toon level using them. Go back to your filter and select \"Disable by Item Level\" and start at the highest level and select them downward (probably leaving only heirloom and tier 1-6 unmarked). This will remove all the items iLevel 200 and up, leaving you with only quest and non-heroic items usually obtainable pre-level 80.\r\n\r\nI use something similar to this on my recently leveled Boomkin to guide me to quest rewards that I haven't done in Northrend and to particular instances that drop upgrades. Let me know if this helped you out.\r\n\r\n(BTW please remember that some things will be off a little or possibly a lot since Rawr is designed for lvl 80 characters.)",
