    "Description": "When switching between various 1h maces, swords and axes as an Orc prot warrior I'm seeing no change in my expertise displayed, which I think is making the new 232 ilevel axe display as a worse upgrade for me than it actually is. I'm not seeing the same issue in the dps warrior model.",
