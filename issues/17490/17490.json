    "Description": "Hi sorry this is my first time posting so if i get anything wrong i apologies.\n \nI may be missing something here but in-game i have 948 haste rating (28.91%) while in Rawr unbuffed in the same gear it shows me as having 30.74% haste. I'm not sure where this discrepancy is coming from. I have added a screenshot from Rawr in the attachments. Here is my armory link for comparison\n \nhttp://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Darkmoon+Faire&cn=neonic\n \nYou can also see in my screenshot it is 30.74% BEFORE procs, so its not that.......am i missing something?\n \nThank you and please keep up the awesome work\n \nNB: Edited as per request.",

      "Message": "1) This has been asked and answered, you don't load all the models when the program starts, only a cursory check of what class/model they are. Removing/Disabling them would be negligible.\r\n2) Usually there's a Buff or Class Ability or Special Proc (trinket, enchant) that is multiplied in, you probably just don't see it immediately.\r\n3) I agree",

      "Message": "Thank you for the report, Neonic.  First, a note about the way you submitted your issues: you should create a separate one for each.  As Jothay said, your first is a duplicate so no need to create one for that.  We'll use this for your second.  Please create a new issue for your third (feature request) so I can track it separately after this one is closed.\r\n\r\nAbout the haste discrepancy: please check out what Jothay suggested (perhaps there is a talent, buff or trinket you're overlooking?).  In the options->debug tab try turning off special effects, which will eliminate most procs from all calculations.  If it still looks wrong, please attach your character file.  In general, if there's any way you think it could be even slightly helpful, always attach your character file to issues.",
