    "Description": "So I downloaded Rawr 2.2.24 yesterday and imported my character from the Armory. (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Nazjatar&n=Dadimi)\nAfter a bit of looking around I found where to look for better gear, what to enter where, etc. (Don't know more than how to see my DPS and see what is better, so don't expect wonders from me)\nI activated about every buff there is (seeing as I have all of them, in every raid I'm in) except for Bloodlust.\nNow what really made me wonder is the following:\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/i/rawrtroll.png/\nNow I know from Bink's Spreadsheet that Haste CAN give some weird values... (although there it's only been with like 1.7k Haste or so)\nSince I didn't know what caused that, I switched to Orc... and voila, problem solved oO\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/i/rawrorc.png/\n \nNow what's really weird is that this happens on other stats, too....\nIf the char is a Troll and Bloodlust is not activated, than the Haste-value is, with a lot of fight durations, negative...\nAnd if I change to Orc it works well, except for activated BL and 10mins Fight duration. (that one is very weird)\nAnother thing that worries me is that Bloodlust changes the value of Haste rather big... don't know if that's really so much...\nI mean... if I take a 9min30sec fight, my SP vs. Haste with BL is 3.66 vs. 3.3.\nIf I deactivate BL, it becomes 3.62 vs. 3.82... so BL(in a nearly 10min fight) lowers the value of Haste by ~14%, which is too much if you ask me.\n \nWell, that's all... can anyone confirm this?",

      "Message": "Well that's a case where you are at a certain haste spot where the relative stat values are messed up. You should notice in the equipment display that items with haste on it don't get devalued although none might think so when looking at your screen shots.\r\nBloodlust, Troll Berserking and other short time Buffs are averaged over the whole fight duration, then an average rotation is calculated and with the result of this calculation dps and the other values are calculated.\r\nIn short it's working fine, however don't trust the relative stat value chart.",

I'll just try to take working values. (seeing as those bugs are only at some special points)",
