    "Description": "Rawr and in game agree that I have 248 mp5 when self buffed (except for water shield).  When I put on water shield, Rawr says my mp5 is 378 while WoW says it's 388.  This makes it look like the correct forumla is 100 for water shield + 10 if you have the 2pcT7 + 30 if you have Glyph of water mastery",
