    "Description": "For some reason, when i try to switch to the Hunter, Warrior, Warlock, Rogue or Priest modules in rawr the program just freezes up. All the other classes and specs seem to work properly. I'm currently running v2.3.20. I have tried clearing all of the different versions of rawr off my computer and re downloading several versions from 2.3.15 through 2.3.20 and have encountered the same errors. I thought this might be a problem with the version of .net i was running so i completely uninstalled the .net framework and reinstalled v3.5 sp1 as directed in the readme/faq for rawr. This did not solve the problem either. I've been using rawr for quite a while now on several of my characters and it would be really disappointing if it will no longer function on my computer. Any help would be very welcome.",
