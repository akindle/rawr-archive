    "Description": "In 4.0.19.0b (in-browser version, and the same when that is installed offline), Darkmoon Card: Hurricane is showing the 321 Agility, but not the Nature damage proc in the tooltip. It is apparently noted in the item (under Edit Item) but I'm unsure whether it's actually being modeled since the listed dps value seems a little low for something with 321 Agility AND a huge damage proc.",
