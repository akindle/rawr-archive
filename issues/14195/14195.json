    "Description": "Hello.\nI just made a little test with mage T9 gear...\nAnd I was strongly estonished that the 4T9 set bonus seems to be not more interesting than 2T8 set bonus... in fire spec(20/51/0).\nDps calculate (assuming hit caped) with 2T9.25 & 2T8.25 = 7454\nDps calculate (assuming hit caped) with 2T9.25 & 2T9.10 = 7479\n \nSo, my question is : Is the 4T9 set bonus correctly implemented in the calculations?\nThank in advance for your interest in this issue...\n \nps: And once again, many thanks for this amazing usefull and well design software :)",

There is this Regalia tagged in my Buffs-pane when equipping any of those 4 pieces at once, but not markable differences on numbers.\r\nOr could the 2T8 & 2T9 be so powerful combination that going 4T9 doesn't effect much or goes even worse?\r\n\r\nBrilliant software though. Thumbs up!",
