    "Description": "I've noticed a few errors when trying to custumize gems. First, for customizing gems on current gear, won't let me customize anything higher then Perfect uncommon gems. I'm having issues getting Jewelcrafting gems of all variatieys to be customizable onto gear, as well as Nightmare Tear or other Metagems then the \"Prefered\" gems for that spec. When i loaded a char with a gear with a JC gem or different meta, it would show up in database, but if i swapped off the object, the original with said meta/JC gem would vanish from options. Any guesses what im doing wrong, or if the database needs to be updated.\n \nEdit: o ya, and on the issue of meta gems, when i use the Optimize option, it seems to ignore my metagem's requirements....like it advises basicly i use ONLY 23sp gems, even though the 21 crit gem requires 2 blue gems.",
