    "Description": "I told somebody in the Discussions section that I would upload my ItemCache.xml for his use - it's got quite a few items that aren't in the distributed xml.  The only thing that's NOT in here that I wish I had time to put in is all of the Brutal Gladiator's gear from S4 Arena.  I've also only updated the druid sunwell loot with accurate stats (I only really play my druid endgame so that was all I updated - sorry everybody else!).\n \nI have un-gemmed all of the equipment, so that you can gem it yourself with either the auto-gemming tool or manually.\n \nThere is one caveat to using this ItemCache - it's LARGE - I've got I think 6500 items in it presently.  There is a possibility that if you're on a slow machine (crappy workstation at the office), Rawr may choke a bit when you open the item editor.  If this is the case, then you need to decide whether you want to use this one or the one that comes with Rawr.\n \nYou will also need to use my image pack - as I've got items that aren't in the Armory yet (sunwell and S4), you won't have some of the needed images in your current itemcache.  Just unzip the images into your present rawr\\images\\ directory and you should be good to go.",
