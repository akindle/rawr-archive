    "Description": "I tracked down the exact issue in the XML files, but since the ilvl 232 set is called \"Khadgar's Regalia\" and the ilvl 245 set is called \"Triumphant Khadgar's Regalia\", putting on ilvl 245 T9 gear will not activate the set bonuses in Rawr. Renaming the SetName attribute in ItemCache.xml of the pieces saying \"Triumphant Khadgar's Regalia\" to \"Khadgar's Regalia\" served as a good workaround for now.\nÂ \nThe same issue applies to Sunstrider's Regalia, which just applies itself to \"Khadgar's Regalia\" (fine) or \"Triumphant Khadgar's Regalia\" (doesn't exist in BuffCache.xml) for simplicity's sake.",
