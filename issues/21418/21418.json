    "Description": "While it appears under the ProtWarrior, Bear and ProtPaladin modules.   The selection of boxes pertaining to boss attack speed do not show up for the TankDK module under the buffs tab.   Nor does it appear to be checked (or unchecked) by selecting the 'Fully Buffed' or 'Unbuffed' presets.  \n \nEDIT - TankDK module doesn't give the option of clicking 'Stat Multiplier' (Kings/Motw) either.",
