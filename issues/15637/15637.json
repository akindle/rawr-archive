    "Description": "I'm trying to add the latest items to Rawr3.  I go to Tools>Edit items, then hit \"Add\".  I've tried typing in the item name (Nevermelting Ice Crystal) as well as the item ID (50259).  If I have both Armory and Wowhead checked, the box closes, but the item isn't added because it isn't showing up when I look for it.  (I don't have any item filters applied).  If I only select Wowhead, I get an error that the item isn't found.\nÂ \nI've successfully added items before, but I think it was an older version of Rawr3.",
