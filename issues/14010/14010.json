By removing TBH it shows 25001 - so that might be the case of average trinket uptime. \r\nBut Pally is different, cus it has under Options ''Trinket Handling\" - which is now same for Ignore and Average Uptime.\r\nAnd the weird part is, when I load Pallys on the same Rawr, TBH dont show up any armor bonus, not even on tooltip, but on the Warrs it shows up.\r\n\r\nHere is my char attached. Rawr shows 31166 armor without Devo aura, while it actually is 25875. And I have only Furnace Stone as Use armor, but same as like TBH it doesnt show that.. Also by applying Devo aura I should get like 1806 armor increase but in Rawr I get 34961 which is more than twice the amount.",
