Regardless of whether it is selected or not, I am not seeing gem names in Rawr 3.  This applies to both equipped gear (left pane) and potential gear (the right hand pane).",

The socket bonus still shows (and is greyed out or not depending on what gems are there) but no actual gems.   The slots are still there in the edit mode so it seem to be just a display issue.     \r\n\r\nI was editing items to add socket bonuses and adding custom gemmings before trying to click on the slot in the paper doll to change to a different gemming when it happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
