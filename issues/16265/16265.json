    "Description": "Any chance that a form of GPGPU could be added to Rawr to speed up Calculations.  There's vendor specific like Nvidia's CUDA(http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn.html) or vendor agnostic like DirectCompute(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectCompute) and OpenCL(http://www.khronos.org/opencl/).   The addition of these would greatly decrease the time it takes to use the optimization tool, and other similar tools in Rawr.",

You want a bunch of unpaid theorycrafting enthusiasts who spend their free time to help us deciding about our gear, to totally rewrite their application, potentially spending weeks or months to learn a new programming paradigm, which you yourself admit to understanding nothing about, just to save you 20 seconds when using the optimiser?",

It was a suggestion to see if it was possible and if it was possible without too much work (I personally have no idea about any of this stuff) then it would be a good addition to Rawr (some optimises take 10+ mins on my relatively powerful PC).    By the sounds of it, it is a lot of work so it is perfectly reasonable to give it a miss.\r\n\r\n",
