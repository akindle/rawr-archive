      "Message": "To be more specific, this seems to be a strictly DPSWarr.Fury model issue. Both DPSWarr.Arms (Makkah on Akama) and Retribution Pally Bristef on Akama) models seem to be working OK. My own toon (Turambar on Akama) shows all items as 0 DPS until I select the highest valued Off-Hand enchant (Avalanche not Landslide?) then it will reflect most DPS values. However, enchants, reforging and gems are still highly skewed (Sta/Hit gems valued higher than straight Str?) Also note that this issue applies to both the EJ SL version as well as the downloadable WPF one.",

(Verified that enchants changed from Avalanche to Landslide as BiS enchantt so should be good to go).\r\nUnfortunately my toon (Turambar@Akama) already had Rend deselected (as well as the other \"Arms\" abilities) so this \"trick\" didn't work for me. Attaching file and here are a few observations: by selecting the recommanded BiS enchant (Avalanche?), I go from 0 DPS to a few hundred and by selecting T11 10N Average Boss the Survivability scale starts showing numbers but I still haven't been able to find the root DPS issue cause.",
