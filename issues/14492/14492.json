    "Description": "I'm trying to plan out a un-hittable block set. Currently my planned set has dodge+parry+block+miss = 100% which is the goal. But looking at the miss percent it seems really high. Against a lvl 82 with 1104 def rating my to be missed is listed as 13.51%\nI did some research and http://www.tankspot.com/forums/f63/40003-diminishing-returns-avoidance.html has a nice table that says that for 1100 def rating the pre DR miss would be 8.95%. That plus 5% base -.4% (for 2 levels higher) gives 13.55% which is almost exactly what is being reported. The actual chance to be missed from the table though is 5.90% a total difference of about 2.5%\nÂ \nI've attached the xml for the gear set I was looking at.",
