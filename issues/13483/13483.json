    "Description": "Easy test:\n - Load up a bear file in good gear in 2.2.6 where you obviously have highest stat AGI.\n - Note the value of greatness, its very high. Note the exact value.\n - Edit greatness AGI version, edit both the procs on heal and on damage change 300 highest stat to 300 agility\n - Note that the value of greatness card just went down....it should stay exactly the same since your highest stat is AGI.\n \n The reverse of the above is true for a well geared cat.  Changing 300 highest to 300 AGI makes the trinket shoot up the scale.  It should stay exactly the same.  You are in theory not actually changing the trinket by changing 300 highest to 300 of your manually defined highest stat.\n \nAlso - there is a bit if you scroll down on the item setup under Old Equipment Procs you can see 300 highest stat.  I suspect it shouldnt be here?  Changing this value doesn't seem to do anything but it's clutter :).",
