    "Description": "First of all, I love your product and use ist a lot.\nIf you look at my char (xml File attached) with the 2.2.4 Version of your tool at the slot relative stat value, you can't find a value for haste. \nAlso the value of spirit of 1.16 seems to high compared to spell power 0,96 DPS. At least I can't see reasons why spellpower is less valuable than spirit.\nÂ \nGreetings\n   MeisterLi, Rat von Dalaran, Germany",
