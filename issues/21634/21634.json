    "Description": "I adjusted \"Hits to Survive\" in an effort to get Rawr to choose a healthy mix of red, yellow, and blue gems. I selected the Average Boss. At 2.8 hits to survive, solid ocean sapphire is ranked as the best gem for me. At 2.7 hits to survive, solid ocean sapphire is ranked as the worst gem for me, well behind solid sky sapphire, for example. This is due to a huge negative burst rating.\n \nI'm guessing that more stam would prevent my health from dipping below 35% and proccing my bedrock talisman. Still, it doesn't seem like stam should have a negative rating on any boss except Baleroc. Do healers try to keep the tank topped off in the TankDK model? In that case, too much stam would seem bad because it would force healers to burn their mana instead of letting the tank dip below 35% occasionally. What would happen if you changed the model so that healers try to keep the tank's health just high enough to survive the selected value of \"Hits to Survive\"?\n \nRefer to \"US Fenris Kariel negative burst\"",

This means that more stam will work against you when given our current health pools and the boss(es) you're facing as compared to avoidance.  Also, which tier average boss did you select? \r\n",
