      "Message": "Well, in the charater file i have attached, i have the [Polished Dragonslayer's Signet] equiped in my finger 1 and 2 slot, and i only have 1 of that ring, so when i go in my Finger2 tab in the comparison window and uncheck the [Polished Dragonslayer's Signet] then it usually keeps the ring in finger1, and now when i go to Finger1 tab in comparison window then the [Polished Dragonslayer's Signet] is allso unchecked there. So if i check in finger1 tab that i have that ring available for that finger and equipts it, then i allso think its available for finger2..",

      "Message": "The rings are not marked as unique - yet they are a quest reward so they are definitely unique as you can only do the quest once. Probable solution - edit the item (use Tools | Edit Item and select the ring from the list) then tick the box Unique and save.\r\n\r\nThis should hopefully fix the issue.",
