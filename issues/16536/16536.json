    "Description": "Would it be possible to add resilience rating to the optimizer constraints?  I realize that dps optimization is far from accurate in pvp situations, but it would be helpful to at least see, for example, what the \"best\" option is for my gear in a set that has at least 800 haste rating and 1000 resil as requirements.  If there is a way to do this already that I have overlooked, could you point me in the right direction?",
