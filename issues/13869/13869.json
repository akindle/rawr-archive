    "Description": "Rawr seems to calculate Rune of Razorize for Dualwield twice, makes it best Rune while leveling because it stacks froststrike damage up to 21% if both weapons got the rune. Naturally its just faster on 10% and the second hand should get rune of the fallen crusader or berserking.",
