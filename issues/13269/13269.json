    "Description": "Per the 3.1 mage compendium post on Elitist Jerks, the Rune of Razorice has only affected the applying death knight's own damage since the release of 3.1, yet in the latest version of Rawr I can still check Rune of Razorice and watch FFB and FrB damage increase. Obvious workaround is to not check that box, but it should really be removed altogether or have no effect so people aren't theorycrafting incorrectly.",
