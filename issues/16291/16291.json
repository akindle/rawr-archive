    "Description": "I think Rawr is undervaluing this trinket for Shadow Priests and likely also for any other class that can take advantage of rolling DoTs (I think maybe affliction warlocks).  When this trinket is used right before casting Shadow Word: Pain, the dot will carry the inflated crit chance through being refreshed by Mind Flay due to the priest talent Pain and Suffering.  This makes the trinket extremely good as it is basically a static 920 crit rating to Shadow Word: Pain in most fights.  However, Rawr is telling me that the Abyssal Rune from regular ToC 5 is a better trinket than this one.\nÂ \nTo show the effect I have described, here is a world of logs parse where I used this trinket as described: http://tinyurl.com/y9bkq7f.  As you can see, my Shadow Word: Pain crits considerably more often than any of my other spells.",

Even on Saurfang, it is fairly easy to keep the dot refreshed on him while dpsing the blood beasts.  It's not really that useful on the Gunship battle but I don't think too many people are worrying about their dps on that fight.",

Putriced MAYBE, if you can snipe a quick Mind Flay on Put while dpsing the oozes (doubtful though). Council is less friendly since your switching ever 30 seconds. Dreamwalker, is even worse since it's an add fight with many adds. Lich King (will be attempting him this week), moderate amount of usability.  You will be switching to adds a lot throught the fight until 40%. Besides Phase 2, you should be able to snipe a quick mind Flay to refresh. However at 40% your going to be Mind Seering adds from 40% to 9%.",

I don't keep corruption rolling in the first wing because the adds need dps and the enrange timers are long.\r\n\r\nOn Festergut, there are several setups that will allow a warlock to roll corruption\r\n\r\n1. Stand in the center and leave a teleport circle on the ranged group that you may be asked to deliver spores to.\r\n2. Stand on the outside and (if human) use every-man-for-himself to get out of puking\r\n3. Stand on the outside and equip a Wintergrasp pvp trinket as your second trinket\r\n4. Stand on the outside and hope you get lucky.  Your luck should be inversely proportional to your haste, because haste makes corruption drop off faster.  It would be nice to get some hard uptime numbers for this scenario.",
