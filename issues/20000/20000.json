    "Description": "Having a heck of a time fixing the filters.\n \nSome of the problems I have encountered are as fallows:\n \n* Multiple Source data has valid locations and also reports \"Not Found on Armory\" so when sorting out things like Tier 11 Raid drops they still get reported because they are also list as not found on armory.\n \n* Still not able to get BOP Crafted items to work under the new \"Filter by Profession\". Problem seems to be that the items just do not get excluded, and they fall to the \"Other\" filter at the bottom of the filtering list. \n \n* Archaeology is really not a crafted item and is not included in the two profession learnable by players. This will be moved to its own filter as it is learnable to all players, and the items are BOA and not BOP.\n \n* Still testing to find out why other items are not being filtered correctly, but this will have to wait till I get my wife all her quest and raids done as she is hounding me to get back into the game.\n \nMore to fallow... Later...",
