    "Description": "Noticed some odd behavior with spirit under the Relative Stat Values tab, with a deep holy build (including the spirit --> spell power talents).\n \nIn theory, spirit should contribute to burst healing, due to spirit --> SP for holy priests.  With no buffs enabled, this is not the case under the Relative Stat Values display.  However, if you check the Spirit --> Divine Spirit buff and the Food --> Spirit Food buff, all of a sudden spirit gets a healthy chunk of burst healing added to it.  This seems to happen with different priests, using typical naxx raid gear.  To make things more strange, sometimes it will happen when only one of those buffs are checked, other times it may require both buffs.\n \nThe spirit gems under the Normal Gems tab seem to have the correct amount of burst healing attributed to them though.\n \nThis is using the 2.2.0 beta, but also appears in 2.1.9.",
