In another attempt, i have seen it pop up a window with before/after gearset, but this time it didn't. Clicking the Cancel button also has no visible effect.\r\n\r\nPS. Is it possible to add the equivalent of an hourglass cursor and/or a progress bar, when Rawr3 is working for more than say 2 sec?",
