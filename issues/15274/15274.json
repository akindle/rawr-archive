      "Message": "When both are selected, the DPS increase is being calculated but credited to neither - this is a bug. When specced into crypt fever but the buff is not checked, it automatically takes into account crypt fever's impact on your diseases, as it's impossible to not have crypt fever up for your diseases if you're specced into it. Likewise, if the buff is enabled and there are no talent points in crypt fever, the buff will get credit for the DPS increase.\r\nBasically, this is just a display issue that occurs when both crypt fever talent points are taken AND the crypt fever buff is enabled; the effect is being taken into account in all situations and is included in your DPS, it is just not always being credited to the right place.",
