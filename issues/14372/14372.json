    "Description": "Hey there, thanks for the recent update - resolved some of the wild filtering. Just curious if the ToC trinkets Solace of the Defeated/of the Fallen in all four flavours are going to be modeled correctly in a future upgrade? It's getting a bit old to add the \"on helpful cast 16/18 mp5 for ten seconds, no cooldown, eight stacks\" every time a new version is coming out. Cheers!",
