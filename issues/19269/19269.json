    "Description": "In b4.0.10.0, bear model, looking at the list of cloak enchants I see that Enchant Cloak - Protection claims to give 250 *armor* while the Wrath equivalent gives 225 *bonus* armor.  I think it's extremely unlikely that this enchant will actually give 250 *armor* as this would mean that it would receive the bear form armor multiplier, which would make it much better for bears than for other tanks.\nÂ \nI can't test this in-game, I'm afraid, as my enchanter isn't at the appropriate skill level yet.",
