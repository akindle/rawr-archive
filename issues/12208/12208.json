    "Description": "I have an issue where windows that pop-up from the \"Tools\" section (Refine types of Items Listed/Optimize/Edit Items, etc...) cannot be resized.  The bottom border cuts through the buttons so that I can't see what they say, and there is no \"click and drag\" available.\n \nThe \"Set Default Gems for Equipment\" window also cuts through the buttons, however I can resize it with \"click and drag\".\n \nThis sure makes it difficult to use.",

My best guess is that either you have some custom UI skin that's interfering, or you have your DPI set higher than normal (Display Settings > Advanced > DPI.   Set that to Normal (72 I think)).",
