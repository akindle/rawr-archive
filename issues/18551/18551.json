    "Description": "Ok, I can see that it's getting filtered out for some reason:\nThe proc isn't modeled/parsed from wowhead/armory, so I'll get that sorted. On top of that, for some reason PhysicalDamage procs are not being included in the list, so even if there was a parse for the proc, it wouldn't have been thought of as a valid weapon since there are no other stats on the item.\nÂ \nI'll get those 2 things worked out. Thanks.",
