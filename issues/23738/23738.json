    "Description": "Several bits of wording in the guardian 'summary' section are wrong.  I think there was some confusion about DR standing for damage reduction rather than diminishing returns.\n\nPre-Dodge DR should be Pre-DR dodge.  \nThe mouseover should be changed to \"The amount of dodge before diminishing returns\".\n\nPost-Dodge DR should be Post-DR dodge.  \nThe mouseover should be changed to \"The amount of dodge after diminishing returns; this is what is shown on the character sheet.\"\n\nPre-Armor DR mouseover should have the additional note of \"This is what is shown on the character sheet\".\n\nI'd argue that \"pre-armor DR\" should be named \"lvl armor DR\" and \"post-armor DR\" should be named \"boss armor DR\".\n\nIt might also be worth adding mouse over for total mitigation specifying that it is using the \"post-armor DR\"/\"boss armor DR\" for this.",
