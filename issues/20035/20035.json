I know Shaz is still working on the model.",

    "Description": "If I view stat values -> relative stat values on my DK, it shows a number of stats contributing a negative value to my survival. Notably strength, agility, dodge, and parry all _decrease_ my survival instead of increase it. Armor decreases my threat, which is just wrong since I have the talent to add armor to AP.  \n \nAlso, I feel like threat is over valued and mitigation stats are undervalued, though that may be a side effect of my relatively low gear level.\n \nI've attached the file.",
