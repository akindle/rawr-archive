    "Description": "I noticed the default Destrolock rotation includes Corruption.\nAccording to EJ number-crunchers, Corruption isn't worth it to Destros when standing still and nuking, and is only for movement periods in fights.\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f80/t38033-mage_equivalent_destruction_warlock/#Destruction\nÂ \nI checked it out a bit in Rawr 2.3.17, and my rotation does indeed have a higher DPS without it than with it.\n(Attached: Lucifel Destro replenish)\nI know you've got a lot on your plate as it is with the Lock module, but it might be worth a sec to snip that out of the default rotation when you get a chance.",
