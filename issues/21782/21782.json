    "Description": "This has been touched on before but is still an issue.   In most programs, if you load a file, the application knows which file you are working on and when you want to save it you just hit \"Save\" and it writes over the file you loaded.  If you want to save to a separate file then you choose \"Save as....\" and give it a different name.\n \nIn Rawr, you basically are hitting \"Save as....\" each time and have to specify which profile you want to overwrite.   I live in fear of saving my resto profile over the top of my boom profile or vice versa.     And that is ignoring the fact that I have multiple specs set up for multiple toons and often have a couple of profiles open at once.\n \nIt would be nice if Rawr followed the conventional UI rules.",
