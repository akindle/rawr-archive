    "Description": "several pvp and tier pieces do not show up as available when selecting pvp or tier sets. several items only show up when selecting VoA as a source.\n \nie: furious gladiator items available through VoA are not available when limiting sources to pvp items only (pants, gloves, chest)\n \nwould be nice to select tier 7,8,9,10 instead of requiring the raids commonly associated with them since all are available from badges save the t10. \n \nrelentless weapons are no longer available yet show up as selectable items.",
