So if you are using the web version of Rawr, it's going to follow whatever your browser is set up to do. If you install the web version offline, it will either use the browser's proxy or the OS's proxy (most likely the browser's).\r\n\r\nIf you are talking about the WPF version, we haven't built any options in for proxies yet.",
