    "Description": "Based on this blue post:\nFix/Adjust Icy Talons and Imp. Icy Talons for Buffs, & DPSDK & TankDK\nYou put 5 points in Icy Talons. While fighting (and applying Frost Fever), you swing 20% faster. If you have talented Windfury Totem on you, you swing a total of 40% faster.\n \nYou now put a 6th point in Improved Icy Talons as well. You have a passive personal 25% haste at all times. When you engage in combat and apply Frost Fever, you now have 45% melee haste. If you have Windfury also, you still only have 45% haste since Windfury and Improved Icy Talons are exclusive.\n \nThis is basically a 20% haste buff to any DK who has Icy Talons and Improved Icy Talons. \n \nSource: http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425523023-please-clarify-this-dk-note-iit.html",
