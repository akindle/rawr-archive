    "Description": "The warlock mod still freezes up when I try to add spells to the casting priority list. I've tried about 10 times now to put in the Affliction rotation, but it freezes when I hit \"save.\" I've tried letting it sit for 5 minutes or more, but Rawr just stays frozen. \n \nThe warlock profile I was using *is* an affliction spec, so I don't know what could be the problem, other than some sort of bug.\n \nedit: I am running Windows Vista, 64 bit. Is there any other information about my system that might be relevant?\n \nedit: Ok, so here's a step-by-step on how to crash it: \n1) Put the priority list as follows: Haunt, Corruption, Curse of Agony, Shadow Bolt.\n2) Put Unstable Affliction at the bottom of the list. It shouldn't crash.\n3) Now, put UA right above Shadow Bolt. This will crash it.",
