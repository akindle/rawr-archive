    "Description": "Current Beta build b4.0.12.0 Shadow Priest model is giving spell hit benefit from Twisted Faith based on base spirit.   This is not correct.  Twisted Faith \"grants spell hit rating equal to 100% of any Spirit gained from items or effects\".  It should not grant Spell Hit based on base spirit.\nÂ \nIn game if I remove all clothing I have 196 spirit, but 0 Hit Rating (while talented into Twisted Faith).  In Rawr if I do the same it shows me with 180 base spirit, and 180 Hit Rating.  If I remove points in Twisted Faith in Rawr, my Hit Rating goes to 0.  So Twisted Faith is currently incorrectly tied to base spirit, and should only be tied to item or effect Spirit.",
