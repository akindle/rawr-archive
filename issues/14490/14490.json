      "Message": "Idol of Perspicacious Attacks is a Druid idol, but it has no stats listed in the Rawr DB. It adds 120 DPS to Maul and 24 to Swipe, sounds like a good Tanking piece, but it is not even in the list. Also a lot of idols have no stats for them as well. Relentless Gladiator's Idol of Resolve show that it only activates when you use a spell, but it actually activates when you use Maul. A nice threat piece, but again not included in the calculations because Tanks do not use Spells. There needs to be a Maul Ability setting in Rawr for these calculations.",
