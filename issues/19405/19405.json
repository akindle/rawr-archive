    "Description": "Rawr.DPSwarr seems to value expertise too high, seeing as after I hit the 26 expertise cap or above, it keeps requesting that I reforge my stats for Expertise as well as using more expertise gear. I don't think this would be intended. \n \nI don't have a file to attach, but I'm sure if some of you do similar tests, you'll see the same thing (or I hope you would, anyways).\n \nEdit: I attached a xml file of my gear/Rawr wanting me to keep reforging to expertise after 26.\n \nEdit 2: Also, I noticed that gems are valuing Mastery and combination of Mastery and Stam. I know that Mastery is preferred for Arms, but is there a way for the program (despite being a generic DPSWarr component), to recognize a Fury setup? I feel like it should value Hit or Str.",
