      "Message": "Currently, I do not believe that this is an issue.  Yes the resto shaman model was showing just showing healing and I think survivability.  Now it has split that healing up into burst and sustainability.  This is because in the options panel, you can pick what type of \"rotation\" you can use for burst moments and what you use when you want a sustained healing output.",

      "Message": "The total healed calculation was off of the original creation of the restosham module when SWP was end-game.  At that time, chain heal was still king and was all that mattered.  With the future changes, many other styles will become viable if not better.  Moving towards burst/sustained has been a goal.  In the next build, you should find that the calculations are much closer to real life then going off the total healed model.",
