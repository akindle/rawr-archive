    "Description": "b5 version of Rawr3 on EJ, Mac OS X 10.6.3, Safari browser.\n \nIf you select the bear model and the options tab, there are two settings for content level.  In both cases, the settings for \"T9 Raids (10)\" and \"T10 Raids (10)\" are ineffective, by which I mean that selecting them from the drop down list does not change the value in the corresponding numeric field.  Hilarity ensues.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\n \nSelect \"Normal Dungeons\" in the survival soft cap drop-down.  Observe the corresponding numeric value is 90K.  Now select \"T9 Raids (10)\" or \"T10 Raids (10)\" and observe that the value does not change.  Now select any other content level and observe that the value does change.\n \nSame behaviour on the raw target damage drop-down.",
