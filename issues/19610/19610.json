    "Description": "With the current state of the game where all similar iLvl items having the same stamina on them, including survivability seems to be unnecessary and may (not sure) be complicating optimizer runs - although Kitty optimizing seems really quick compared to some other models. Also, survival these days is far more to do with not being dumb than about gear choices :)",

      "Message": "There's almost no performance or complication benefit to dropping to it, and you can always optimize by DPS, or sort charts by DPS... Is it too highly valued or something? It really should have 'some' value, because if it doesn't you start seeing things where 100sta is equal in value to 0sta, so things crop up like it not picking up stam socket bonuses even when it would cost no DPS (just shuffle gems around).",

      "Message": "No, the value looks fine and I do indeed optimise for DPS, it just doesn't seem to be particularly relevent in todays raiding when iLvl is the main factor in the survivability score.   A stam socket bonus is certainly relevent I suppose.    It does also result in stam trinkets & gems appearing in the lists.\r\n\r\nCertainly there is no real downside to leaving it as is - was just a suggestion/idea more than a request :)\r\n\r\n",
