    "Description": "I'm having a rather strange issue where I really can't explain why one item is considered better than the other. The \"better\" item is worse in almost all stats, and it just seems like some error. I can live with this error in Rawr, but I'm worried that there are other errors which are not as obvious.\n \nThanks for an otherwise good product!\n \nI have attached a zip file with two images showing the error and a xml for my character which gives the error. \n \nOh, and I have had the error in both 4.0.16 and 4.0.17, not sure about and other versions.",
