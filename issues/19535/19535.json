    "Description": "r56637 of the Rawr addon exports a copy of my character. However, when imported into Rawr 4.0.14.0b on Elitist Jerks, the character appears without any gemmings. In Rawr, the tooltip reads \"Item not found - Automatic Armory Item Lookups Coming Soon.\" Attached is a copy of the export from Rawr.\nÂ \nIn the example attached, the meta gem should be Ember Shadowspirit Diamond (itemID 52296) with a Brilliant Inferno Ruby (itemID 52207) in the blue socket. However, in Rawr, both still appear as Item Not Found. Every gem appears to be missing in all sockets, according to the program",

      "Message": "Seems odd that the ites are already in the item cache, but cannot be looked up from the itemID provided in the import.  Also, the whole point of the import is that you don't have to use the armory import. As referenced by both Jothay and Levva in the discussion thread http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=237068, \"Nonono, you shouldn't have to do both, if addon import is broken we just need to fix addon importing not design some other process based on something broken.\"",

It is missing gems, WHICH gems is it missing. ie: please write something like for slot X it should show gem Y & Z etc.\r\n\r\nIs it just gems it is missing for you? Is it every gem? Whilst your export file is useful we need a lot more info to narrow down the problem. So if you could please let me know what gems you actually have and what is missing. This will allow checking of what is equipped vs what is loaded",
