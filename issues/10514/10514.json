The number of \"wtf this is broken is says item A is better than item B, which is obviously wrong\" reports was staggering. I got tired of copying and pasting \"Does A have a gem of a color that you need to satisfy your metagem requirement, and B doesn't, and you have Enforce Metagem Requirements enabled?\" everywhere.",
