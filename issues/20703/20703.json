    "Description": "When you are not busy:) perhaps you would consider a one click function to lock the gemming, enchants, reforges, etc. of the all the currently equipped gear.\n \nFor example I get my gear rigged for the bear. I would like to lock all these specific items so Rawr won't try to change the bear gear gems, enchants, etc when I optimize for cat. Currently I can do this by marking each equipped item with a blue diamond and clearing the diamonds for all the alternatives. \n \nThis is a lot of clicking and is error prone. Doing all this with a single click would be nice.",

Go to the Equipped > Gear chart, undo the green diamonds, mark blue ones.\r\n\r\nAnd isn't the core concept of what you are actually trying to accomplish built in to the Progressive Optimizer of Batch Tools? I think that makes this unnecessary.",
