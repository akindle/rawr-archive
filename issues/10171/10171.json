    "Description": "I really appreciate the addition of the Survivability score to the Cat model and the Threat score to the Bear model in b14. Unfortunately, in the Cat model, enchants with stats which would only benefit the Survivability score have been omitted from the drop-down lists. (In the Bear model, enchants which would only benefit the Threat score do still seem to be available.)\nÂ \nI agree that enchants that provide zero contribution to dps are not usually optimal for the Cat model. However, as a feral druid, I am often called upon to off-tank substantially hard-hitting adds (e.g., Tidalvess) which require my bear gear and then continue in cat form to dps the boss (e.g., Karathress). For this reason, I sometimes switch to the Cat model while in my tanking gear, to get an idea of my expected dps and survivability should I not be required to tank an entire fight.",

      "Message": "I'd like to note that this is also true of gems, and potentially of all items in general. I realize that changes you make to this might cause any item with any stamina to appear as potential selections in the Cat model, but the same thing already happens with the Bear model and its Survival score (i.e., leather items clearly intended for balance or resto druids will be shown.)\r\n\r\nIn the end, I don't think this is a bad thing. Yes, the list gets much, much bigger. However, it would allow a player who is considering respeccing to see how his or her current gear might fare in that new role and show him the next most obvious upgrades and their relative value.",
