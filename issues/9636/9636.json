    "Description": "If the Armory is acting flakey, like it is at the moment, and you try to load a character, and it gets the character xml OK, but then doesn't get a response on either the character talent xml, or the talent icons, it'll crash... CBenn, can you track that down and add some null-icon-handling to TalentIcon, and probably just a nice error message for bad talent responses, and continue to load the character with no talents? Also, add a null check around the talent string parsing, since characters may be untalented.",
