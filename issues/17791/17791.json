      "Message": "Wait, nvm, try to run it again and it goes error from start. RAWR has encountered a probelm and needs to close. Forget even getting it started again. Also of note, to get THAT far, I had to select the zip folder properties and make sure the file permissions were not read only. For whatever reason, this zip in vista, which I never had the problem with them before, seems to want to make some folders read only, which will obviously cause problems for anything rawr needs to write to disk. Anyways, love the program, hope these issues can be worked out.",
