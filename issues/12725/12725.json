      "Message": "Appears #7 and #8 will be removed and simply changed to add OOM to the optimizer.  In all testing, Burst sequences could be used as sustained, so there is no real reason for burst sequences, it should be left up to the shaman to decide when he needs to just use Tidal Force and Nature's Swiftness for the emergency burst.",
