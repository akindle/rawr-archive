    "Description": "When I am scanning through various items I find that some have the text wraps back upon the same line (Check Headpiece of Fungal Bloom for example).  The gems need to be stacked and not side by side to prevent this and give more room for the description.\n \nAlso no information on the type of armor and slot it uses (example Plate, Cloth, Chain, or Leather, or if the weapon is main, Two-Hand ect) cannot see that in current tooltip.  Could it be formatted the same way it appears in game with the same info.\n \nAlso when you select a item and choose to edit it there should be a cancel option in case you mess it up!!",
