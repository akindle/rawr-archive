    "Description": "Using 2 models for 1 character:\nPrimary: TankDK\nSecondary: DPSDK\n \nSteps:\n- Uncheck all item filters \n- Import Spec 1 (tank) from Addon, adjust buff settings & Select T12 10M Average Boss & Save character XML\n- New Character\n- item filters should still be unchecked\n- Import Spec 2 (DPS) from addon, adjust buff & Presence on options, & Save XML\n- Launch batch tools & Import both Tank then DPS saved XMLS\n- Run progressive optimize.\n \nExpected:\nProgressive optimize should optimize based on the 1st character XML, and then lock those gear selections in for what's possible for the 2nd character.\n \nActual Results:\n1st character optimized correctly as expected, but 2nd character is optimized oddly. Gem & enchants selections match the 1st character model. \n \nHard to explain, I'll post XMLs that hopefully better explain.  I'm thinking that Enchants and Gem Templates are only using the 1st model, but I haven't diffed the actual expected vs actual results XMLs in Araxis yet.",

If it would be more useful we could make it so it combines the available lists from all characters, it wouldn't however limit choices for each individual character to only items it has marked available.",

That marks all the same items available in the other profiles as well.   \r\n\r\nOne hassle I have is that for items like the firelands rep stuff and molten front rewards, it is fairly cheap to buy two of an item and just reforge it differently for each spec.   This isn't easily handled with the batch tools.    You could duplicate the item with a different name but for rings and trinkets the optimiser may try to use both for the one spec.\r\n\r\n",
