    "Description": "These prior BiS trinkets for Cat suddenly have fallen to terrible levels.  As near as I can tell this is because Rawr doesn't think they have good uptime.  In practice the uptime for these is amazing.\nÂ \nSimilarly Quicksilver Alch Stone and DMC:H which previously were terrible is now very high.",

      "Message": "Previous version this file was perfectly optimized.  Now it wants to change trinkets out.  Tia's/Fluid/Unheeded were top of the pack with only 372 Essence of Cyclone better.\r\n\r\nDMC:H and Quicksilver were terrible, about the same level that Fluid Death is currently showing.  Grace of the Herald (now showing above Unheaded) was not even on the first page let alone anywhere near a good trinket.\r\n\r\nI set Fluid Death to 1 AGI per stack instead of 38.  This dropped it about 200 points in the scale.  This tells me it's valuing the 342 AGI difference as about 71 AGI by my rough calcs.  No where near correct.  Fluid Death has near perfect 10 stack up time.  \r\n\r\nWhy Unheeded Warning dropped I have no idea.  As Hinalover said, ever since the buff in 4.0.6 it's been BiS.",

In looking at this, I am seeing that Tia's Grace is supposed to be Melee or Ranged Attack, doesn't seem to require that they hit, so the item has the wrong trigger. Lemme fix that first before continuing",
