    "Description": "In changest 53632, the equation to get the base hit was changed from \nfloat·\tHit·\t=·\t100·\t-·\t(\tStatConversion.\tGetSpellMiss(\tBossOpts.\tLevel·\t-·\tcharacter.\tLevel,\t·\tfalse)\t·\t*·\t100)\t;\n-or-\nfloat·\tHit·\t=·\t100·\t-·\t(\tStatConversion.\tGetSpellMiss(\tcalcOpts.\tTargetLevel,\t·\tfalse)\t·\t*·\t100)\t;\n \nto\n \nfloat·\tHit·\t=·\t100·\t-·\t(\tStatConversion.\tGetSpellMiss(\tcharacter.\tLevel·\t-·\tBossOpts.\tLevel,\t·\tfalse)\t·\t*·\t100)\t;\n-or-\nfloat·\tHit·\t=·\t100·\t-·\t(\tStatConversion.\tGetSpellMiss(\t-calcOpts.\tTargetLevel,\t·\tfalse)\t·\t*·\t100)\t;\n \nThe result is that it thinks that the base hit chance for a shadow priest against a PvE target 3 levels above it with no buffs (no misery or shadow focus) is 107%.  Obviously, this is not correct.  This problem exists in both v2.3.22 and b3.0.3.22.  Don't even need a character sheet to replicate; just create a new character with no gear, (make sure the target level is set to +3,) and mouse over the Hit display.  As both the CharacterCalculationsShadowPriest.cs and Solver.cs files were changed in this way, this affects both the display and the optimizer.",
