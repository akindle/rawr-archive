    "Description": "Posting up as requested by Shazear.\n \nDpsdk module posting melee swing speed at .2 slower than in game.\n \nIf I might make an assumption, it may be due to not being able to select presence, as unholy gives 10% haste (10% of 2.5) which may be applied before the 15% from talents.",
