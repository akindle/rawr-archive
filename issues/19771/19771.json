    "Description": "I just picked up the downloadable wpf version of rawr, and loading the rawr.protpaladin module seems to cause an instant crash.  This happens if I try to load in a prot paladin character or if I start fresh and change the class to Paladin>Protpaladin.  It sadly does not give any error information beyond \"Rawr.wpf has crashed\".  When I set the class to a number of other specs and classes, this doesn't seem to happen, so it appears to be specific to rawr.protpaladin.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\nSimply try to load a protpaladin character or create a new protpaladin character in the wpf version of rawr.\n \nRawr 4.0.16b wpf\nWindows 7 Ultimate 32-bit",
