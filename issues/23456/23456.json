    "Description": "Using the following XML, the Optimizer solve (both full precision and 10x full precision) returns a suboptimal solve worse than existing equipment.  This is really odd given that during the solving process, the max-dps-found-so-far indicator had reached much higher numbers.",

      "Message": "After more experimenting, I think the issue may just be aesthetic in that whatever dps number the main window shows, is not calculated the same way as the the dps number in the optimizer.  But I don't believe the optimizer would find a higher maxima no matter how much I muck with initial state or precision level.",
