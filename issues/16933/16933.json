    "Description": "Was just messing with the ICC crazy buffs and noticed that the buffs didn't increase my health (damage works fine). I went and found it in the code and discovered that the calculation for BonusHealthMultiplier is being effectively nullified by Floor(), meaning you need a BHM of at least 100% (o.O) to see any changes.\nÂ \nFix included. ^^",
