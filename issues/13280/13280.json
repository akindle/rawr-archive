      "Message": "I downloaded RAWR 2.4.4 on a new pc straight from this site, with the exact same results. This pc has never had the app on it before. So as far as I can tell it has not been corrected. \r\nJust FYI, RAWR isn't in program files or the registry. It seems to run directly from the folder. So deleteing the folder, deletes the app. Which is what I did originally. So there's no way I was running both versions at the same time. Regardless, I tried it on a new pc anyways.",
