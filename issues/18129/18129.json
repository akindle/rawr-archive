    "Description": "2.3.18 says DPS rises slightly when Glyphing or improving Slice and Dice through talents.\n2.3.19 says DPS is reduced by over around 100 per glyph/talent point when improving Slice and Dice. \n \nAFAIK SnD is pretty much the key to rogue DPS no matter the spec, so it's a pretty big difference if Rawr is reducing the DPS for just putting straight points into it.\n \nattached is one of the rogue profiles having the issue.\n \nI've tried it on 2 Separate Rogue profiles and the result is the same.",
