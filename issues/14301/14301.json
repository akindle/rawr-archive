    "Description": "Rawr is reporting that my defense is 547, but when I log in and check it in game it says 532. I've been having this problem with Rawr since I first downloaded it a few days ago. As a DK that is trying to use this program to optimize after I get DPS capped I find this very flustering. Can someone please fix this bug or explain what I am doing wrong?",

      "Message": "Correct.  I'm working on getting the rotation triggers more involved w/ actual numbers shown in the UI, so as long as you have a 30 sec or less rotation, and have an IT in there, then you get the extra defense.  Admittedly, I don't personally gear assuming that the buff is active anymore, but it's a good cover for when you may be short.",
