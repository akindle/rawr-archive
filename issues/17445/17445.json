    "Description": "I know my character is not yet up to endgame level but while playing around with my toon in Rawr 2.3.15 I noticed something strange. Since I run mostly 5-man PUGS (LF Raiding Guild) I only select self buffs and noticed that if I select the same in the Ability Maintence options (i.e. maintain ability to buff myself) my overall DPS drops significantly. Specifically if Sunder Armor is selected in buffs I gain about 277 DPS but if I maintain it myself (through ability maintanence) I lose this gain. Same occurs with Battle Shout if selected as a buff and also as a maintained ability. I saw about a 11-12 point drops on other abilities due to the loss of a CD and can live with that but the Sunder Armor and Battle Shout losses seem way too high.",

      "Message": "I don't know the answer, but I'd guess that if you select it on the buffs tab it's assumed that someone else provides the buff, so you're not actually maintaining it unless you also select it in options.",

Can you use GCD's to explain why Commanding Shout, which lasts for a shorter time than the glyphed Battle Shout, only costs me 11-12 DPS to maintain versus the almost 280 DPS to maintain the longer lasting Battle Shout which should increase my DPS.",
