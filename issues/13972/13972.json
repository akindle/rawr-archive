    "Description": "It is impossible to equip two Signet of Bridenbrad rings. \n \nThey are a  quest item that are soul bound.  You  will only have one. \n \nI was looking to optimize for +Hit while I gear my tank up.  It presented the option of having the same ring in both slots. \n \nQuest items should be treated like Unique equip items.\n \nThis is on the web based version running on Mac OSX 10.5.7",
