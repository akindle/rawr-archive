    "Description": "In bear model change item sorting to DPS or Survivability, and then change to cat model -> Rawr pops up an Unhandled exception error and all item sorting goes wrong. In some other module (pala? can't remember at the moment) I had a similar error where you have a specific sorting enabled & then change model -> Rawr bombs on you.\nNormally I've been able to just click on continue & change sorting to get things working again, but since .19 I've had an issue once or twice where the sorting continues to be all bugged.\nSeems like Rawr just needs to change to default sorting if you change your model.",
