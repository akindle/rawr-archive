The v4 folder has the usual goodies while the v4.0 folder had a single line showing  REG_SZ and deprecated (under data).  Using the .NET download repair feature at the moment to verify. If that fails, will try removal and reinstall.\r\n",

      "Message": "Interestingly enough, Kavan, while I cannot find one iota of difference in the registry, or anywhere else, it seems that running the .NET download through its Repair process fixed something.  I wish I could tell you what it fixed but since the .Net is the same version and all data is identical after repair, I cannot.\r\n\r\nWhat I can safely say is that a post can be made that REGARDLESS of the Error Message, if RAWR fails to launch, the first step is to ALWAYS run the .NET download (in this case dotNetFx40_Full_setup.exe for me) and either 1) Install or 2) Repair.\r\n\r\nThanks for you patience. It was simply too odd for the 4.2.3 to run and the 4.2.4 to not... so running a Repair did not make sense.  Not sure what it fixed, but RAWR 4.2.4 is up and running. :-))\r\n\r\n~Tex",
