    "Description": "When running Rawr on a display with increased DPI (in my case 120px/inch, or 125%), the interface gets very messed up and makes it difficult to use. As illustrated in the attached screenshot, the button sizes and placement are all over the place and on some it is impossible to read the gear enchant. The gear comparison bar graph has gotten better, but when text ends up running into a third line, the spacing between the bars is no longer sufficient.\nA new issue I noticed in 2.3.2 is that the popup list of gear that shows when clicking on a piece of gear will sometimes stretch out the icon in the list to much larger than normal.",
