    "Description": "I noticed in the last 2 versions, hit rating is over valued for rogues.  I'm running close to 400 hit rating now unbuffed, and it is still saying that dated items are upgrades only because they have hit rating on them.  Some other spread sheet makers seem to under value hit rating at the moment.  I do like a lot of the rogue changes that have been made in the last 4 or 5 versions.  And I find it to be a very useful tool.   Keep up the good work!",

      "Message": "It seems to me that somewhere melee and spell hit rating conversion numbers get mixed up. With 393 hit rating, the module tells me that i am 78 HR above the poison cap, and yet i get 0.01463443 % missed poison attacks.\r\nWith 394 HR i get 0 % missed poison attacks.\r\n\r\nHow it should be calculated:\r\n394 HR = 15,0198... % spell hit, + 5 % (Precision 5/5) = 20.01... % poison hit\r\nWhat i suppose is calculated:\r\n394 HR = 12,0158... % melee hit, + 5 % (Precision 5/5) = 17.01... % poison hit\r\n\r\nWhile the caps are correctly displayed under \"Basic Stats\", something is calculated wrong for the \"Complex Stats\".\r\nAttached is a config with 393 hit rating, change the gem in wrists to Accurate Monarch Topaz to see what i tried to explain above.",
