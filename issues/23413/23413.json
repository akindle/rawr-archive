    "Description": "On a kitty decked out in the best quest gear available, fully buffed, gemmed and enchanted with the boss handler set to the average T14 10N boss, expertise is showing as being worth more than hit.     The option for 100% behind boss is set so I would assume that Hit & Expertise should be of equal value unless I am missing something.",
