    "Description": "For Blood Death Knights, Rawr converts 50% of the strength above base strength to parry rating.\nHowever, as of WoW patch 4.2, it should be 27% of strength converted to parry rating.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\n  1. Launch Rawr.\n  2. Select Death Knight - TankDK class and model.\n  3. Make sure that no buffs, no talents and no glyphs are selected.\n  4. Note that in Stats panel it shows 0 parry rating, which is correct.\n  5. Equip single item with strength on it, without gems and reforging. For example - neck \"Necklace of Fetishes\" with 256 strength on it.\n  6. See, that in Stats panel, it shows 128 parry rating, which is exactly 50% of 256 strength, while it should have been 27%.\n \nAdditional Information:\n  Rawr v4.2.5",
