    "Description": "Both these talents have a max of 3 talent points rather than 5 (like they had early in beta/ptr).  Please update ClassTalents.cs to for these 2 talents to be:\n \n        [TalentData(15, \"Moonfury\", 3, 0, 2, 6, -1, new string[] {\n@\"Increases the damage done by your Starfire, Moonfire and Wrath spells by 3%.\",\n@\"Increases the damage done by your Starfire, Moonfire and Wrath spells by 6%.\",\n@\"Increases the damage done by your Starfire, Moonfire and Wrath spells by 10%.\",})]\n        public int Moonfury { get { return _data[15]; } set { _data[15] = value; } }\n \n \nand\n \n        [TalentData(26, \"Earth and Moon\", 3, 0, 2, 10, -1, new string[] {\n@\"Your Wrath and Starfire spells have a 100% chance to apply the Earth and Moon effect, which increases Arcane, Fire, Frost, Nature and Shadow damage done to the target by 4% for 12 sec. Also increases your spell damage by 1%.\",\n@\"Your Wrath and Starfire spells have a 100% chance to apply the Earth and Moon effect, which increases Arcane, Fire, Frost, Nature and Shadow damage done to the target by 9% for 12 sec. Also increases your spell damage by 2%.\",\n@\"Your Wrath and Starfire spells have a 100% chance to apply the Earth and Moon effect, which increases Arcane, Fire, Frost, Nature and Shadow damage done to the target by 13% for 12 sec. Also increases your spell damage by 3%.\",})]\n        public int EarthAndMoon { get { return _data[26]; } set { _data[26] = value; } }\n \n \nNote that the actual calculations involved for these two talents is correct.  The problem is only in allowing selection of more than 3 via the talent selection tab.",
