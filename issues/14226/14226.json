    "Description": "I noticed that the Horde's set is named Thassarian's Battleplate/Plate instead of Koltira's Battlplate/Plate. I don't think this has an effect on showing whether you get 2pc/4pc set bonus, however I discovered that having 3/4 of one iLvL and the fourth having a different iLvL, it will not give you the 4pc set bonus, possibly the same with different iLvL for 2pc as well.",

Though I did discover the actual Thassarian pieces do work regardless of iLvL where as the Koltira pieces don't. Someone just messed up the Horde set somehow.\r\nIf the all the sets are standardized on the Alliance names for sets, then why is there even a listing for Kolitra's Battleplate/Plate in the set bonuses list? This confuses half the people using Rawr and can cause problems in the database.",

If you remove the extra \"     \" at the end of all items, they'll stack and give setbonus (tested with 3 pieces conq and one triumph)",
