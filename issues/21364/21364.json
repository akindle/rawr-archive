    "Description": "After the last update, the survival soft cap input is no longer adjustable. It seems to now be directly tied to the boss handler, however it changes drastically depending on which bosses I choose and then isnt always the same for each boss if I switch back and forth. \n \nEx: I have it set to T12 10N Average boss, it sets the soft cap to 435000, but if I switch it to say Shannonx, and then switch it back to Average boss it now becomes 567000. \n \nI don't know if this is related or not but every time I change anything in the boss handler it also changes my characters survival score, didn't used to do that.",
