    "Description": "Usually when Armory is down Rawr answer is fast: There is error with loading character or there is no response from armory.\nSometimes Armory is buged. It doesn't answer to Rawr nor to Internet Browser at all.\nIt cause Rawr to hang during character reloading. \"Cancel all\" is greyed out, closing window doesn't work.\nI can either kill Rawr in Task Manager or unplug network cable (then after a while \"armory returned no character\" appears).",

No Error 404 - just hang without end.\r\nAre you sure Rawr Armory Reload is immune to a case when Armory does not return Web Page nor Error 404 but just hangs?",
