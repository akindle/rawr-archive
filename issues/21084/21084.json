    "Description": "On the gear ranking graphs, the total score for the top ranked item, and usually several items below it, is clipped.\n \nWould it be feasible to either fix how the width is calculated to include the total value text, or perhaps add the different component values (and the total) to the item's tooltip? Or maybe a new tooltip for the bar itself?\n \nAlso, component values within a bar are often visibly clipped when the bar is not as wide as the text. Having them in a tooltip could solve it. Just make sure the tooltip doesn't disappear after a few seconds like all the other tooltips (also could use fixing!) in Rawr.",
