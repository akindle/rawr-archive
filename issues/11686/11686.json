    "Description": "Rawr greatly over values \"threat\", and to a lesser extent, \"survival\", in placing gear in the comparison window.  Rawr is placing DPS items with no substantial tank stats other than armor and stamina at the top of the comparison lists.  For example:\n \nThe top rated helm is \n \nObsidian Greathelm\n- Armor 1908 \n- Stam 145\n- Str 98\n- Crit 76\n- Expertise 59\n \nWhile this is a fine helm, I very much doubt any Tankadin will be wearing it for tanking heroics or raids.  The calcualtions need to put more emphasis on defense rating and the other various mitigation values (block rating, block value, dodge, parry), and less value on \"Threat.\"  Also survival, while an important component, also feels a bit overvalued.",
