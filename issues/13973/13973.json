    "Description": "My latest Filters for Rawr. Allows you to select professions and filter out for almost any situation for pre-raid and planning. Also includes a quick switch that lets you see everything in the database so you do not have to search for where it is in the filters. By default all profession items are disabled, but if you have that profession, just enable it to show the BOP items when you view crafted items. No more missing out on an item because it was lost in the current Rawr filters, this one filters it all. Even filters gems and only show BOP gems if you enable jewel-crafting as you profession.\nAny problems, just let me know and they are as good as solved.",
