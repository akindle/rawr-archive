    "Description": "If the pvp set items are available, the optimizer seems to ignore the hit cap and just returns with the max DPS set without hit capping.\nCould not find any settings to make the optimizer always hit cap (using spirit and +hit items) for pve raiding.\nÂ \nAlso, the model seems to suggest sometimes a spirit -> hit reforge, which is pointless for shadowpriests, in fact, it is against the optimum due to spirit = hit (with 2 points in the Twisted Faith talent).",
