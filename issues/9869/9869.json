CoS and Misery and it goes up to 2557.\nThese are easily visible as being incorrect, most likely a monday error somewhere in the math.",

Maybe is taking BonusShadowSpellPowerMultiplier and BonusSpellPowerMultiplier and adding them.\r\n\r\nLike, 10% from SpellPower for CoS, and 10% for ShadowSpellPower from CoS. Total, 20%.\r\n\r\n1844 x 1.2 = 2212.8\r\n\r\nI can't imagine where your numbers for CoS and Misery came from. Doubling them (supossing CoS with malediction) is 13+13+5+5, 36%, but 1844 x 1.36 is 2507.84. Too far from 2557.",
