      "Message": "I'm rather sure that the auto add spell to rotation code is not working properly,\r\nThe MF/SFx4 rotation caps out haste gains at 323, any haste past that gives no DPS, But it continues to give DPS to the SF Spam rotation.",

    {
      "Message": "The way I have it implemented is that if you have insufficient haste to add another spell to the rotation without either clipping a DoT tick or letting the DoT drop, it will not add the cast.  This is probably why you're not seeing any more increases in DPS on a DoT-bound rotation, whereas pure Starfire spam will give DPS increases because there is no DoT component.",
