    "Description": "First off, sorry if this has been answered before, but after Searching on both the Rawr codeplex site and elitistjerks.com I could not find an answer. \nWould it be possible to add two extra gemming templates to the DPSDK Rawr model for those still using the Blood spec? The templates meta Would be Relentless Earthsiege Diamond with a Nightmear Tear to activate the meta with in the gear. Also, it has been stated that the use of this meta for the laxer requirements to activate it can work out to a net DPS gain over the Chaotic Skyflare Diamond. This information is also posted in both the Blood, Unholy and Frost elitistjerks.com forums along with the WoW class forums. I am not sure if it could be done but maybe in the Options plane have the option to pick which meta the player prefers, and then the gemming templates can in short adjust to this option.",
