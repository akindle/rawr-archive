    "Description": "Wowhead allows you to apply a weight scale and sort items.   It'd be nice to have RAWR able to generate and export  off to that for searching for interim upgrades.  This would be especially useful for leveling on newly leveled alts -- often what you want to do is be able to search for \"show me quest rewards and world drops, sorted by an appropriate rating scale\".\nÂ \nI realize that RAWR does dynamic calculations based on each item, and this assumes a static valuation.  But by being willing to assume a static valuation, it allows use of wowhead's extensive quest and drop location database without trying to replicate that functionality in RAWR.",
