    "Description": "I recall that this has been discussed before, and I thought it was resolved that the holypriest model would be renamed Healing or Heally or somethign like that, so that \"New Users\" would not constantly post issues-bugs that Disc priests were not modeled.   While I know this was a few releases ago, it still has not changed.  Of course, I can not find this old post.  So, I am posting it again in hopes that it reminds someone.",

      "Message": "as a side issue, and not an issue at all: I am just looking for opinion:\r\nas a Disc priest, healing 5-man heroics... am I correct that the 'best' role to select to optimze with is Disc-Raid? or is this role tuned for a 10 man to a point that makes it a bad idea to use on 5-man?",

      "Message": "For 5mans it probably isn't a massive issue either way.   I'd use the one you suggest but if you prefer you can use the \"Custom Role (You Pick)\" options and you can enter the number of each spell you would use commonly over a certain period of time (maybe 5 shields, 2 penances, a PoM & 3 flash heals or something).\r\n\r\nWhen i'm doing 5 mans, i'm working on getting my gear ready for raiding so I usually just enter what I would be aiming for in raids (including full raid buffs).\r\n\r\n",
