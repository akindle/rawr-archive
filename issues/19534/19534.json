    "Description": "I see on my spell breakdowns one of the cycles is \"Combustion+FBLBPyro\", which is some 2k higher dps than usual FBLBPyro. I'm guessing that this is still the old working of combustion where it gave increasing chance on crits? If I'm wrong please disregard the rest of this issue and close it. But the damage seems a little low since you can get 10k+ dps out of this, that's why I am doubting it.\n \nThe new working of combustion is explained very well in the fire mage compendium at EJ\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f75/t110326-cataclysm_fire_mage_compendium/#Combustion:_Fires_2_Minute_Cooldown\n \nBriefly I would like to suggest that it is modeled as follows:\n- treat it as a separate spell, remove it as a modifier\n- presume combustion is cast after cooldown, immediately following the next crit from fireball or a pyroblast! ignite\n- presume LB is up, average the dps\n- presume FFB dot is up, if the glyph is present (regardless if the main rotation is FFB)\n- calculate dps from ignite by averaging fireball and pyroblast ignite dps\n- could also add an option under spells and buff to ask the user if they want to always assume waiting for pyroblast!",

      "Message": "It's using the new Combustion mechanic, but it's quite possible the model for it is not good enough. It is treated as a separate spell already, Combustion+FBLBPyro means cast combustion and continue with rotation, its duration equal to the combustion dot duration. The reason why it's treated that way is to allow cooldown stacking instead of just having it averaged overall.",

      "Message": "My bad then, but consider that Rawr is showing that combustion is only 1% of overall fire mage damage, while most WoL parses are showing mages who get 5% of their damage from combustion. Simcraft goes even higher, predicting over 8% of fire mage damage from combustion alone. So if you have time it might be worth looking into :)",

I'm applying crits and ignite to combustion ticks. Regarding mastery are you saying that it should double dip from it (i.e. mastery when computing dps of individual dots and then additionally on top of it for combustion)? At least from what I looked in simc they don't have it as double dipping.",

Her Ignite is 8513 / 2 = ~4256dps. Her Pyroblast tick is 1760 / 3 = ~587. That's total ~6344dps, but her combustion is ticking for 7268. Her mastery rating is 923 which gives 5.15 mastery or 12,875% increase in damage. So that comes out for me that combustion ticks should be ~7161.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where the extra 100dps comes from. Quite possibly I shouldn't just divide by 3 when calculating dot dps based on logs. It's probably also a calculation based on haste. But it's clear, to me at least, that it is double-dipping, since the combustion ticks are much higher than the combined dps of the original dots.",
