Double click on the error message and post any additional information that you see listed.\r\n\r\nIf this does not help the only course of action would be for you to assist in the testing. For this you would need to install the free Visual C# Express and run Rawr from source. If you feel comfortable doing so let me know and I'll assist you in the process.",
