    "Description": "Some pieces of gear are being \"imbued\" with a severely out-of-whack level of DPS, compared to other pieces.  In the first profile, half of the rings values around 1600DPS, and after the distinct split, 300-ish.  In the second profile, the top item is showing nearly 2000DPS, while the nearest competitor shows roughly 850DPS.  This disparity is quite severe, well beyond normal operation.  Toggling on Flooring drops the DPS ouput by roughly 1200, the rough value being added in either case.  The common stat between all affected items is Haste.  I'm guessing it's some sort of ability usage breakpoint, but with a 5 minute fight, this is a pretty big jump.  It could be related to Shattering Throw, maybe, but that doesn't make any sense.  Working under v2.3.3 mainline release.",
