    "Description": "Unsure if it affects any calculations, but there's a line in Calculations.Tree.cs that includes the following code:\n \n(statsTotal.SpellDamageFromSpiritPercentage * statsTotal.Spirit)\n \nand I don't think spirit is involved in spellpower calculations anymore.  Also, the definition for SpellDamageFromSpiritPercentage  seems to be commented out earlier in this file.  That calculation may end up giving 0 spellpower from spirit, but that's a bit harder to figure out from my end & it seems like usage of that variable should be commented out as well\n \nVersion 58363",
