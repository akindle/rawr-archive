Since mousing over the drop-down list does show data, and when scrolling the list, most things are drawing at least part of each entry, but once I mouse over them, they are covered up again.",

Not sure why on the first click of any item, we see this issue, but subsequent clicks on that same item in a row will draw everything correctly.  \r\n\r\nSo a work-around I suggest is to click twice on a button when in this mode.",
