      "Message": "I need to open your character file and will do that in a few but prelim statements:\r\n\r\nDon't use Optimize with \"Talents\" as that will pretty much guarantee a failed result. Talent Specs is OK so long as you set up reasonable specs and not something really weird.\r\n\r\nBladestorm's value can jump up dramatically with an increased Multiple Targets setting.\r\n\r\nYour XML file shows that you loaded the character and gave some basic settings and set a couple other more advanced ones. However you don't have any buffs active besides Elixir of Mighty Strength (which isn't a very good one). You need to add the rest of the buffs you normally run with. I'm also seeing that you only have the base abilities activated, try enabling Heroic Strikes, Cleaves, the Shout you normally do, Bloodrage, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce you have done that, repost your file and note any differences you see for me.",
