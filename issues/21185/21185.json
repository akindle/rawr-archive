      "Message": "Found an issue around HitChance base that in certain situation could cause hit chance to be lower than expected for melee strikes and thus raising the value to expertise slightly.  So I fixed that.\r\nHowever, re: Haste issues, Haste is invariably bursty in value because it has distinct plateaus in what you may be able to accomplish.  EG, Runes coming up 1 GCD sooner than before.  Meaning you may change which ability is used.  I'll see if fixing the Sudden Doom issue will change this further.  However, given that having a directed dynamic rotation is very expensive, There may be limitations in the more direct priority list that I use for the specs.  I'll take some additional time w/ this once the SD fix is implemented. ",
