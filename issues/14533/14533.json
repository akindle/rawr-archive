    "Description": "Hi, I have a reasonably well geared Hunter with Tunic of Triumph, Legguards of Conquest, Dragonstaker's Helm, 250 EoT and 2 Trophies to either buy the Triumph Hands and Helm to get the 4 set bonus, or Hands and upgrade the Legs. Unfortunately the program does not show any dps increase with the 4 set bonus, so I am wondering which upgrade combination would give me the greater dps increase.\nMy current helm is fractionally better without the bonus taken into account.\nIt would be much appreciated if you could include this in a future release, as I am hanging on here with my currency and somewhat stuck.\nI will let you know my character name and realm if you e-mail me.\nThanks, and great work, this project is really appreciated",
