    "ClosedComment": "In your provided character file, both of those items have a Green diamond on them as well as the Blue one. This tells the optimizer you are not restricted to that one gemming, but all gemmings from the templates AND your blue gemming. To make it only your blue gemming, remove the Green Diamond from another copy of the item in the list. If you are only seeing one, go to Options &#62; Edit Gemming Templates and change the listings value at the bottom from 1 to 2 or 3, then go back to the chart and take off the green diamond.",
