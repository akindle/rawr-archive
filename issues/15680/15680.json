    "Description": "I was wondering if it would be possible to make the currently single DKTank option into 2 seperate ones?  As we all know, expertise/hit is a little more important to a DW tank than a 2H tank and the fast/slow weapon analysis for MH/OH comes into play depending on the stats and such...The current DKTank setup looks to be almost entirely for 2H tanks, specifically 2H Blood/Frost DK tanks and that's it.  If we could have this seperated a bit that'd make the analysis game a little easier on everyone.  Thanks for the great work ya'll do.  Have a good one.",

Unfortunately those aren't synced or utilized by the optimizer at this tim.  The best way to evaluate the right gear, setup your DW tank spec, and then go from there.  It should favor the best gear for ya, be it 2h or DW.",

      "Message": "Well then, I guess the issue is that the current model doesn't recognize when DW tanking is the current build, therefore it doesn't prioritize expertise/hit a little higher and it doesn't factor in the speed of the weapon.  The upgrade list put 1.6 speed tanking weapons as large upgrades over a 2.6 DPS weapon with a higher ilvl and a blue socket.  Seems to me that it doesn't really know what to do with DW weapon selections and stat prioritization.  Just an observation, but ya'll are the pro's.  Thanks for the quick responses.",
