    "Description": "For the last few versions, whenever I load up the batch tools the window has buggy graphics. Initially, I can see part of the \"startup\" window (create new, open, load from armory etc.) then after that most of the window is black until I mouse over a bit or click on a line etc.   \n \nAlso, with a new version, it seems you have to load each of the character files in plain Rawr before you load them with the batch tools and try to optimise or you get the following error :\n \n// ERROR TEXT MOVED TO FILE",
