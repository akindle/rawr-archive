    "Description": "I had been working with the Batch Optimizer a bit for the first time.  I finally got it figured out, and then saved both character files.  Now the holy spec version crashes rawr when I attempt to load it either through the batch file or the individual file.\n \nIs there a way I can recover the file and fix whatever it's angry about in the xml?\n \nSee the end of this message for details on invoking \njust-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.\n \n************** Exception Text **************\nSystem.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.\n   at Rawr.SpecialEffect.Interpolator.get_Item(Single procChance, Single interval)\n   at Rawr.SpecialEffect.GetAverageProcsPerSecond(Single triggerInterval, Single triggerChance, Single attackSpeed, Single fightDuration)\n   at Rawr.SpecialEffect.GetAverageStats(Single triggerInterval, Single triggerChance, Single attackSpeed, Single fightDuration)\n   at Rawr.HolyPriest.AdvancedSolver.Calculate(CharacterCalculationsHolyPriest calculatedStats)\n   at Rawr.HolyPriest.CalculationsHolyPriest.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character, Item additionalItem, Boolean referenceCalculation, Boolean significantChange, Boolean needsDisplayCalculations)\n   at Rawr.Calculations.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character, Item additionalItem, Boolean referenceCalculation, Boolean significantChange, Boolean needsDisplayCalculations)\n   at Rawr.FormMain._character_ItemsChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n   at Rawr.FormMain.set_Character(Character value)\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character, Boolean unsavedChanges)\n   at Rawr.FormMain.bw_LoadSavedCharacterComplete(Object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\n \n \n************** Loaded Assemblies **************\nmscorlib\n    Assembly Version: 2.0.0.0\n    Win32 Version: 2.0.50727.4016 (NetFxQFE.050727-4000)\n    CodeBase: file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework64/v2.0.50727/mscorlib.dll\n----------------------------------------",

      "Message": "Oh, and if it helps, the initial errors before this were when I selected \"custome role\" on the options/role tab.  Selecting that causes Rawr to crash consistantly.  I think I may have been given the option to save the character after that, so I selected yes to not loose the work I had done.",
