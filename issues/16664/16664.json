    "Description": "I upgraded from v2.3.8 where this was working to v2.3.11. Loading my prot warrior from the armory (or from saved file) and I can see bars next the items in specific slots like Head. But if I switch to the Direct Upgrades view, it shows no bars. If I change to the DPSWarr model, the bars show up in Direct Upgrades.",
