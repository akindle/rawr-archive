    "Description": "Doesn't matter which character I try to pull.  Tried messing with the tool :  options  proxy info to change to IE (I currently use foxfire) with no success.  Deleted and re-installed without fixing the issue.  This seemed to happen out of the blue about 1.5 weeks ago, I don't recall changing anything, but there is obviously some issue with my puter setup, as all runs fine on my hubby's puter.  Incidentally it will no longer load the 'did you know' information.  I must have something blocked somewhere, but I'm no computer genius.  If you have a fix for me, please speak in small easy to digest words for the less computer savvy,  Thanks in advance.  (oh, btw checked, armory isn't down when I am trying to pull these, regardless of the error message).\nÂ \nError Message:  Step Name: Get Character\nDescription: No character returned from the Armory. The Armory may be down.",
