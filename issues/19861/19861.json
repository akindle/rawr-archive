    "Description": "I have a mage, and I have successfully used the Rawr Addon to export my character to Rawr and optimize and find upgrades.  However, when I use File -> Export to Rawr Addon, hit Ctrl-C, and then paste into the /rawr import, I get the following error:\n \nRawr: Rawr: Invalid Rawr data entered please check you have copied data from Rawr to the clipboard using CTRL-C\n \nI've tried a few times, both the copying and also the generation of the code in Rawr, so I don't think I'm doing anything wrong in the process.  Attached is the code that Rawr produces for the Addon in case that is helpful.  Thanks.",
