    "Description": "IÂ was wondering if there could be a standard time before out of mana for all the applicaple mana users out there, and i know there are ones for some of them, but like enhance shammies it'd be good to know for example the effect getting improved stormstrike would be, or maybe for a ret pally how much getting their replenishment talent is worth, and obviously having it be affected by whatever buffs you have on and stuff.",

      "Message": "That is, depending on the variables, one set of gear could last 5 minutes or 15 minutes.  It depends on the fight, the ability usage, the target(s), etc.  Saying \"you will last for 5 minutes irregardless of variables\" is naive.  I mean, even in your request, you say A) that you'd like OOM to be a standard, flat number across the board, and then go on to say B) that you'd like to have it affected by variables.  You can't have both - it's dependent on the variable output, plain and simple.\r\n\r\nNow, what WOULD be good is an output of how long a given model is lasting, instead of having to guess based on the model's recommendations.",
