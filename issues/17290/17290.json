    "Description": "I currently have this equipped with a Delicate Cardinal Ruby +20 AGI and 22 AGI enchant which produces ~449 dps.\nThe optimizer shows me that if I replace my gem with a Shifting Dreadstone +10 AGI and +15 STA, with the same enchant, the dps produced will jump to ~616.\nÂ \nHow is this possible as their seems to be a net loss of 6 AGI?",

As it's a blue socket it could be that it's trying to get a wrong socket bonus, if it for example has the socket bonus at 40 Agi instead of 4 the gem swap would indeed be worth it due to the incorrect socket bonus.",
