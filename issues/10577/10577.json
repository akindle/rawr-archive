      "Message": "I've made a fix that will somewhat alleviate the problem, but I doubt there will ever be a 100% solution for this. At the core of the problem is that this is a very tight border case situation where your mana regen increases just enough that you can no longer use full 5 gem+pot based on the estimates used. In reality things will depend on luck depending on how much mana you actually get restored, so for now I just relaxed the constraint a bit to allow more mana consumables to be used. Using SMP will give a more accurate result because it calculates mana constraints per segment now, but even that will only work up to the resolution of the segmentation which is 30 seconds right now.",
