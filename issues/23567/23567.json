    "Description": "When using this XML, and doing a Maximum/10x Optimizer solve, the result returned is lower than the currently-equipped set (by 30 dps).  Granted that's a very small amount of relative error, but perhaps the currently-equipped set should be processed as a solution to avoid \"regressions\".",
