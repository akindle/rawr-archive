    "Description": "I know Elem Shamans are currently buggy due to the lack of an elem dev available, but I thought I would point out something I noticed.\nÂ \nI noticed that when my mouse over my estimated DPS, it says that I am casting 125 lightning bolts a minute, and only 5.8 lava bursts per minute.  The ratio should be 11 LB : 2 LvB.  It is currently estimating around 43 LB : 2 LvB.  Clearly that is a huge error.",
