    "Description": "Rawr is fantastic!  One thing that would make it better is if you could filter which sources to use on a per-character basis, much like you can refine the types of items that get listed for each character.\nÂ \nThat way I could set my raiding main up to see raid sources, while my alts could be set up to see just heroic/badges sorces, or whichever ones are best for that particular character.",
