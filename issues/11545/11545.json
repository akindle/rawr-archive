    "Description": "The moonkin form does not cause the Armor entry on the stats page to update.    The following change will make it so that Armor is updated based on form:\n \nIn Rarw.Moonkin.CalculationsMoonkin, change:\n            statsTotal.Armor = (float)Math.Round(statsGearEnchantsBuffs.Armor + statsTotal.Agility * 2f);\nto:\n            if (character.ActiveBuffsContains(\"Moonkin Form\") && character.DruidTalents.MoonkinForm > 0)\n                statsTotal.Armor = (float)Math.Round((statsBaseGear.Armor + statsEnchants.Armor) * 4.7f + statsBuffs.Armor + statsTotal.Agility * 2f);\n            else\n                statsTotal.Armor = (float)Math.Round(statsGearEnchantsBuffs.Armor + statsTotal.Agility * 2f);\n \nAslo, on the talents tag, the entry for Moonkin form says the contribution from items is increased by 400%, It should say 370%.\n \nFinally, as a purely cosmetic change, if you move:\n                    \"Basic Stats:Armor\",\nfrom right after: \n                   \"Basic Stats:Mana\",\nto right after:\n                   \"Basic Stats:Spirit\",\nits easier to do a visual compare between the wow paper doll and rawr",
