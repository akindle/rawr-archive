    "Description": "The batch optimizer kind of assumes all items are unique.\nWhen building a progressive upgrade list for Cat/Bear gear sets it doesn't see that for example set items can be obtained multiple times so these items don't show in the upgrade list for Bear if I they are equipped for Cat as it only considers them when gemmed / echanted the same way.\n(I don't think example files are needed to fix this but it they are just ask, don't have them with me atm)",

For Cat this is correct as I already use that but for Bear it would be a direct upgrade as I can gem/enchant the 2nd for Bear.\r\nThe Upgrade list should contain Bloodfall heroic but it doesn't as I already have it (once).",
