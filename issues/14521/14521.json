This is a model issue for one or more models, there isn&#39;t generic code for this.If the items stats are visible in the model, but the item valuation doesn&#39;t seem correct, then this is a model specific issue.",

    "Description": "I'm just going to rattle off a couple of items that I've noticed haven't been programmed into the appropriate models yet.\n \n[Pally - Heals] Libram of Veracity - This is a Triumph badge Libram that is giving 0 in both Fight Healing and Burst Healing\n \n[Shadow Priest] Talisman of Volitile Power - It is registering the crit from both the 232 and the 245 versions however the model has yet to factor in the Use effect which causes a stacking SP buff.\n \n[Resto Shaman] Totem of Calming Tides - Not showing up in the totem list\n                        Totem of Forest Growth/Totem of Misery - not sure if the lower cost of the spells should be affecting the scores (currently it has 0 effect).",

I was planning on sending in a ticket with the fix but I could not figure out where in the model to add in the modeling for the trinkets. these includes:\r\n\r\nTalisman of Volitile Power\r\nReign of the Unliving\r\nBinding Light (though not really necessary for SPriest but still want to point it out)\r\n\r\nPlus the Horde variations to these as well.\r\n",
