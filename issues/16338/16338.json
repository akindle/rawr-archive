    "Description": "Opening a hunter from Armory gets the hunter's pets, but reloading from Armory does not. This is probably low priority, but if people have accumulated lists of equipment, etc. it would be great if it worked.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n   1. Launch Rawr\n   2. Open attached file\n   3. Reload from Armory\n   4. Observe that Armory Pets list is empty\n \nBy contrast, if I Open the same character from Armory, I get the hunter pets (but of course not my current gear, gems, etc. options.\n \nAdditional Information:\n    * Rawr v2.3.9\n    * Vista 64",
