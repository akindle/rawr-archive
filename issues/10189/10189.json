    "Description": "Steps I use to reproduce:\n1) Start Rawr b14\n2) Set Rawr to Bear mode.\n3) Load myself (feral druid) from file.\n4) Select \"Gear > Main hand\" in the chart.\n5) Load new character from armory, and then loading a protwarrior.\n6) The charts of the weapons are not aligned. They still show the feral staves, but the red blue and green fields overlap and doesn't start at zero in the chart.\nÂ \nAnd a minor bug:\nWhen using the \"Load from Armory\" the region drop down list is incorrectly positioned in the tab order.",
