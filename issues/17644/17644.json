      "Message": "Kitty druids are the same way. Tuskanar is useless given that our run speed talent overwrites the enchant's speed boost. However the talent becomes more useful if the speed talent is not select (I don't know why a kitty druid would NOT take that talent but you never know). Only thing I would say is default to the speed buff if the talent is not selected (you never know people will sometimes not take that talent).",
