I have enchanted my boots now with Nitro Boots to drop the hit and pick up more crit and the run boost.  I click on the little enchant bar under the boots and when i place the mouse over the nitro Boots enchant I immediately get the pop up message with the error.  I have attached my xml file. \r\n\r\nI even tried reimporting my chr from the armory once the enchant was on there and it isnt applied in the numbers.",
