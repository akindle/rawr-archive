      "Message": "The major source of differences between WC and Rawr that I could find centered around the 4-piece T9 set bonus and whether it is additive or multiplicative.  I have changed it to be additive.  Also note, Rawr does not support the \"feature\" in WC/WoW where you can cancel your current Eclipse at the extreme end of your cast to chain Eclipse procs together.",
