    "Description": "It seems that in the latest code (taken from source control) the Frostfire set isn't modeled at all (or rather it isn't being recognized). I had 2 Heroes pieces equipped and one Valorous, I created a shoulder item the same as the Valorous set piece and both were modeled to give the same dps although the Valorous piece should have completed the 4 set bonus. Looking at the set bonuses under buffs neither the 2 piece nor the 4 piece is shown.",
