    "Description": "On my Hunter I set the shot rotations in Options/Rotations. Currently I am set to Survival. My total dps at the bottom does not change regardless of which rotation I use. Also under the \"Stats\" tab I mouseover each specified shot and they all say (Not in rotation), when I have clearly set my rotation. Somehow there is a pointer missing.",
