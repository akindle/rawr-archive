    "Description": "Right now Vampiric Touch is handled separately by each module as it needs to know how effective it is (i.e. how much MP5 it is worth). Similar for example Judgement of Wisdom might need a setting for the uptime. Would there be value in centralizing these settings so all the modules handle them in the same way?",
