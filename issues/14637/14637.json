    "Description": "Apologies if i am talking Mince but I'm not understanding the budgeting for the above ilevel 128 item which is given an overal RAWR score of 22571 against my Bears gear, above Cloak of the Untamed Predator - 22053ish and Garosh's Rage (ilevels 245 and 272 respectively). Its making my durable Nerubhide cape look flimsy in comparison andalthough i still have the badges for this immense upgrade, i'm wanting to stop by to check first!\n \nOn the surface i could go out on a limb and assume (here i go for embarrassment factor) that the 346 armour on Slikk's is being counted multiplicatively, whereas my understanding is that all that stopped a while back on the contribution of armour from items, weapons, cloaks and rings in feral Dire Bear form.\n \nEither that or someone recognised it from the days of TBC when it was indeed a fantastic item and secured its RAWR fame in history forever :)\n \nIf ive been an ar5e please delete me :)",
