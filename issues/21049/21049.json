    "Description": "After loading an existing character using the \"Reload Current Character from Battle.net\" option does not give the expected result.  Often the progress bar will keep \"progressing\" but the word \"Complete\" will show on the bar.  Clicking OK will cause the button to go inactive, but the window will not disappear until you click Cancel.  Using the \"Load from Battle.net\" option in the File menu seems to work perfectly fine, but all profile options are obviously lost updating this way.\nÂ \nI can duplicate the problem simply by starting Rawr, clicking File->Load from Battle.net, when all is loaded clicking Import->Reload Current Character from Battle.net.  I am seeing this problem in the Silverlight version both on the Elitist Jerks site and installed locally.",

You can verify this by changing 1 piece of gear then reloading and watch it change back. Yes, it doesn't work has intended but it does accomplish the reloading task.",
