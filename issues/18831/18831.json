    "Description": "Rawr reports both rip and rake having a 97% uptime. However WoL and Simcraft consistently show that rip uptime is usually around 90%, and rake uptime around 85%. I've dug around abit in the cat rotation sourcefiles but couldn't figure out an easy way to force lower uptimes for these abilities. Can this be done at all?",

      "Message": "That's the point really; simulationcraft shows that if you go higher than 90% uptime on rip or 85% uptime on rake, you lose dps. Either by not FBing to ensure you can rip right away after it falls off, or by raking when you should be using that OoC proc on clearcasting.",

      "Message": "I haven't seen any evidence that that's actually the case. Just using CCs on Shreds instead of Rakes is a marginal DPS gain at best, and certainly will not cost you 10%+ uptime. It'd have to proc every single time to account for that. FBing is fun for big numbers, but it's DPS gain only comes when you sacrifice very little Rip uptime. ",
