      "Message": "Astrylian is correct.  This is a problem with the AB-ArBr rotation.   From the moment that AB goes off, the AB debuff persists for 3 seconds.   The time between the the ArBr and the next AB is ( 1.5 + 2.5 ) / 1.379 = 2.9 seconds.   If you add in the default 100ms lag assumption, it does seem to mean that more haste is bad because of the AB debuff stacking -- at least from this trinket.",

      "Message": "You are correct. There is a soft cap of 33% passive haste for arcane. As you'll see in spell info pausing for that 100 ms is better dps than trying to add another AB so essentially adding more haste doesn't gain you anything.",
