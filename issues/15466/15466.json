    "Description": "Problem: I use Rawr to pick items that I want to upgrade to by putting the green diamond next to the good pieces that drop from the stuff my guild runs, then optimizing (the same way I'm sure many people use it).  The filters are great for this (though I wouldn't mind seeing more sub-filters for, say Ulduar normal & Ulduar hard, as mentioned in other posts).  However, my guild only runs once section of Ulduar per weak, so I don't really want to optimize for pieces that drop at 1 or 2%.\nÂ \nSuggested \"fix\": simply displaying the drop rate in a tool tip would save me a LOT of back & forth between Rawr and Wowhead.  A filter to exclude them below a certain drop rate would be even cooler!",

      "Message": "You're right, build upgrade list is incremental.  My suggestion is to plan out your set pieces ahead of time, and then ignore those slots in the upgrade list.  If you want to build an upgrade list assuming you have your 2pc or 4pc set bonus, you could mark those four as available (even if you don't have them) before building the upgrade list.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a good solution to build upgrade list giving you a set bonus when you're at 0pc, because usually that first piece is not an upgrade until you also get the second piece if you're breaking a 4pc.  It will, however, work in the following scenario:\r\n- You have T8 chest/helm/gloves/shoulders\r\n- Your T9 helm is an upgrade in the upgrade list regardless, since it upgrades a non-set bonus\r\n- Once you get the T9 helm, usually you will break the T8 4pc for the T9 2pc, so a new upgrade list will consider all 4 remaining T9 pieces\r\n- Once you have 3pT8 and 2pT9, upgrading one of your T8 to a T9 will show up, because you don't lose the set bonus.  Now you have 3T9 and 2T8\r\n- Breaking the 2T8 for 4T9 will now show up in your next upgrade list\r\n\r\nOf course, if you don't want the T9 Helm because it's poorly itemized, this isn't a solution.  But keep in mind that \"Build Upgrade List\" provides you the value of your next one item, and not your next 5 items.  99% of the time this is more practical, because you can't guarantee that both pieces will drop at the same time, and many people don't want to spend DKP or whatever to get an item that sits in their bags until the second item they need drops.",
