    "Description": "I've noticed that Agility has a survival factor.  I've tried to isolate it, and it appears that it's because it contributes to armor still.  I believe that was removed with Cataclysm.  The only value of agility is to provide crit and 0.00328399% dodge (pre DR) per point.\nÂ \nEdited to avoid multiple posts.  I loaded a blank prot pally and gave him a random set of gloves.  Apply the +20 Agil enchant and watch him gain 40 armor.  Error does not persist in prot warrior or bear modules.",
