    "Description": "I'm very happy with the new Rawr Addon cause I think it makes my life with Rawr and the item comparison much easier. But I simply have the problem that after I transferred my character via the Addon into Rawr and then (after some work in Rawr) the upgrade list back into the Addon, the Addon never ever shows me any possible upgrades for the weapon slot. Nevertheless in Rawr there are some possible upgrades for the weapon slot.\nEvery other slot seems to work correctly.\n \nIf it would help you identifying the problem I can post you my character in Rawr this evening when I'm back home.\n \nThank you 4 your help.\n \nAdditional Information:\nRawr Version: Rawr 4.0.19 Beta\nAddon Version: \tRawr v0.63",
