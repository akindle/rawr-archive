    "Description": "In latest 2.1.6 (and previous versions), the trinket Defender's Code is being parsed as only with 850 armor, but the 'use' effect (455 dodge rating for 20 secs each 2 minutes) is missing.\nÂ \nI think it should be averaged at 75.83 dodge rating or something the like (455 / 6, as 1/6 is the expected maximum uptime of the proc).",
