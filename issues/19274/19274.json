    "Description": "Bear model, b4.0.10.0\n \nCreate a new \"bare\" bear, and look at any item slot, say \"main hand\".  Select \"overall\" sort mode.  Observe the values for \"Vicious Gladiator's Pike\".\n \nNow go to the \"options\" tab and select different values of \"Threat Value\" under \"Rating Customization\".  Observe that this does not change the results: Rawr appears to be ignoring the selection. One practical result of this is that its gearing recommendations tend to value hit and expertise very little, even if you're \"crazy about threat\" because rating scaling while leveling has eaten away at your ability to actually do anything.\n \nIncidentally, the \"Survival Soft Cap\" value does seem to be connected to the rest of the application... fiddling with that does change the values assigned to Survival for each item.",
