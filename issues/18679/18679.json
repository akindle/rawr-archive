    "Description": "A friend of mine who is Arcane mage recently made me aware of that there is something strange with the online version of Rawr and Arcane Mages.\nMyselves being a fire mage I really wondered as it works fine for me. Then I tried switching the Talents in Rawr to Arcane and suddenly I had the\nsame issues. The issues being that Mana regeneration is overvalues HUGELY suddenly (for example \"Talisman of resurgance\" is giving a hugely\nbetter value\" than the Halion trinket. And 251 boots with Spirits are shown as better than 277 Plague Scientist Boots (again: Only happens for Arcane).\nAll buffs and options are set correctly, BTW.\n \nInterestingly this only happens in the online (Rawr3) version. In the download version of Rawr it is fine, and\nthe Twilight Scale is still shown as BiS and everything else is fine too.\n \nAs a software developer myselves I know you will want exact steps to reproduce. Here they are:\n \n1. Start the online version and load character \"Maaht\" from EU-Server Kil'Jaeden.\n2. Also start the download version and load \"Maaht\" there.\n3. Compare.\n \nMelliandra",

      "Message": "Altho turning off Incremental Optimizations does have an effect, Rawr never displayed this kind of behaviour before. It seems to show other weird behaviour. For example, loading my character in the online rawr and optimzing leads to a theoretical 1400DPS increase, by decreasing my haste and upping my spellpower with 73. Now i didnt do the maths by hand, but +73sp -1.5% hit shouldnt equate to an 1400DPS increase. It seems to make a rather large jump there where it shouldnt.\r\n\r\n*Using \"Incremental Optimizations\" and going to Gear->Back, it shows my cloak with a higher score using a +12sp +10int gem. When using the optimize tool, it no longer shows this to be true.\r\n*It swaps my rings around but does not regem one (it has the right gem), but it still shows it as 'changed' in the optimization window.\r\n*With incremental optimizations on, things really dont work out alright and mana and mana regen really seem to be overvalued. It never used to do this ! (or was incremental opts. off by default ?)",
