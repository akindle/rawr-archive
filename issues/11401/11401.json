    "Description": "A lot of the UI for seemingly common settings is very different between each of the models and some of them are missing options in some models.  (example, # of innervates or drums of battle).\n \nConsider factoring out the common portions of the configuration UI so that its consistent & complete across all the models and doesnt require each model developer to roll their own.\n \nSimilarly, take a look at the \"displayed solutions\" (rotations, spell dps, etc.) on the first tab of each model which all seem to be very similar but disjoint.  These should probably also be factored out and standardized.",
