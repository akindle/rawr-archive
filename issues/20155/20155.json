    "Description": "I am trying to compile Rawr4 from a clean svn checkout and I get the following compile errors:\n(translated from dutch language)\n \n(in public Rawr.Retribution.CalculationsRetribution::GetCharacterRotation(Character character, Item additionalItem)\nCalculationsRetributions.cs line 467: variable rotation doesn't exist in current context\nCalculationsRetributions.cs line 468: variable rotation doesn't exist in current context\n \nCalculationsRetributions.cs line 780: Rawr.Trigger does not contain definition for SealOfVengeanceTick\n \nCalculationsRetributions.cs line 1145: GetCharacterRotation has no version that takes 4 arguments\n \nAlso the Rawr.Apf can not find the App and LoadScreen tag, but I am guessing this is due to Rawr.UI.Wpf not compiling because of a reference to the unbuildable Retribution dll.",
