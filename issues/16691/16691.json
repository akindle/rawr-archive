    "Description": "I have a problem with the optimizer : It propose to reverse my two weapons which is definitely a bad choice. We need a fast weapon in your left hand for the regeneration of energy and a weapon with heavy damage in the right hands (for critical damages).\nThe poisons are well positioned if they follow the speed weapons (and not left hand / right hand).\nÂ \nTry with my attached profile.",
