    "Description": "I'm seeing some unexplained behaviour in Rawr.Mage and S.R., the included character was changed to not include any mana support, fight length is 5 minutes, at  3:46 it shows as having 3153 mana next part shows at 4:06 0 mana, the graph shows the same and yet there is no big drop in DPS (almost a minute of oom?) and no wanding.",

      "Message": "Sequence reconstruction will in most cases give you meaningful results only if you enable Segment Cooldowns option. That said the reconstruction seems to have some trouble with this particular character, I'll try to make some fixes for it if I'll get a chance but it's a low priority. Check the Rawr.Mage wiki for more details on how reconstruction works and what settings you can manipulate to get better results.",
