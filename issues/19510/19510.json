Perhaps come up with a way to allow for a crowd sourcing method of correcting and updating the item cache.  Seems like this was an issue with Rawr2 as well.  Bad item caches can make the tool just as unreliable as a bad model.  Like this item which is in the upper tier of bear shoulders pre-raid in Cata that was completely missing.",
