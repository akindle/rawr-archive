    "Description": "When I view \"Direct Upgrades\" in the \"Comparisons\" pane and set the sorting to alphabetic,  the last item listed is \"Merciless Gladiator's Mooncloth Leggings\".  I believe this is an issue with the number of items listed because changing the filters results in a different last item being shown even though that last item is not associated with the filter.  With enough filters (more restrictive) all items do make the list.\nÂ \nIs there a known limit to the size of that list?",
