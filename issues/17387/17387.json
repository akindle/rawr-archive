    "Description": "Take a look at the attached upgrade list.  (This was generated in Rawr 3, but it applies equally to Rawr 2.x.)  Note how the top DPS item (Shadowmourne) is so much greater than any other item.  This has the effect of making all the other bars looks insignificant.  What I'd like to do is remove Shadowmourne from this list.\nÂ \nIdeally, I should be able to click (or right click) an item and choose \"Remove from this list\" or something like that, and it would poof.  The bars for the other items on the list would auto-adjust to fill the window horizontally (for the remaining top dps items, of course).  If the item I'm removing isn't the top DPS item, there should be no need for the DPS bars to adjust.  In both cases, the vertical scrolling may need to adjust.",

      "Message": "@Jothay: I was only using Shadowmourne as an extreme example of why I want the feature.  I frequently want to remove items that are unobtainable to me, but not filterable without removing other items. (E.g., there is a guild wait queue on a particular item, and I'm not likely to get it, so I don't want to see it on the list.  But, I can get other items from the same event.)  The request is just the ability to take an arbitrary item off the list after it's been generated.",
