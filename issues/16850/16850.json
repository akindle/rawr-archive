    "Description": "Continuing my investigation of the differences between my guild's rogue and the log posted in a previous issue, I found some points about white attacks:\nÂ \n- Lightning Reflexes should be 4/7/10% haste rather than 4/8/12% as Rawr currently uses;\n- attack power contribution to white damage should be based on base speed, not hasted speed.",
