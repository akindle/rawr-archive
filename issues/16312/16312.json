    "Description": "It seems that when you specify cost options, the optimizer will not check whether a piece of gear is equippable before considering it.  This causes two distinct issues.\n \n1) The optimizer suggests gear that is impossible to equip, such as hunter-only gear for a paladin.\n2) The optimizer will ignore your preference for gear, recommending mail or leather even if you disabled that option in the \"Refine types of items listed\" dialog.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Load the attached character.\n2) Click Tools -> Refine types of items listed.\n3) Uncheck Leather and Mail, then click OK.\n4) Click Tools -> Item Cost -> Reset\n5) Click Tools -> Item Cost -> Load Emblem of Frost\n6) Click Tools -> Optimize\n7) Ensure that the cost option is set to <= 194.\n8) Ensure that the thoroughness slider is all the way to the right.\n9) Ensure that all check-boxes are NOT checked.\n9) Click Optimize.\n10) If prompted to confirm that you wish to proceed with a large number of items, click yes.\n11) Wait for the optimizer to complete.\n \nResult:\nThe optimizer recommends two pieces of hunter-only gear (Ahn'Kahar Blood Hunter's xxx) and/or a mail item (Band of the Night Raven).  The specific items vary from attempt to attempt.\n \nExpected result:\nThe optimizer recommends gear usable by paladins, and only plate armor.",
