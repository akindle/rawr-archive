    "Description": "I tried to load this item (from Brewfest) using the Add function in the Edit Items dialog box, using that Item ID as instructed.  However, it indicated the item is not found.\n \nIn a case like this is it appropriate to hand-populate the item (which I understand is something generally to be avoided), or why isn't it found?\n \nIf hand-populating is the way, how do I determine the percent chance to put in that it will proc the additional spell power effect?",

The trinkets (other than the 170sta ones) are duplicates of the ilvl200 heroism badge trinkets, so you can copy the special effect parameters from those.",
