    "Description": "I have tried repeatedly to get the import from add-on to work, and I am not sure what I might be doing wrong here.  I have looked for solutions on the discussion board and in the issue tracker, but I haven't seen anything with this error.   I have cleared the silverlight cache, verified I am seeing 4.0.14.0b when I reload RAWR on EJ.  The add-on has been reinstalled twice.  Its version 0.23 from the curse site installed via the curse client.  I can export the data without error ingame, but whenever I try to import I get an Arg_IndexOutOfRangeException error.  Attached is the XML data I am pasting into RAWR and the error it is generating.",
