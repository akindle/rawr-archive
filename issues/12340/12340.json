    "Description": "I keep getting buggy results with the optimizer trying to find the best setup for cat dps. I've attached the character below. Also, is there anyway to adjust the survivability value for cat dps? I'd like to set it up to 0 if possible when looking at gear upgrades.\nÂ \nWith the attached character file, my last run of the optimizer by dps rating, full thoroughness, and regem/reenchant checked, it found a gearset of 5430.369 vs the current 5454.3",
