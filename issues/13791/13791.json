      "Message": "Astry: the previous issues opened for this with BrWarner and a couple others were using the updated code (the unreleased 2.2.11) so this new one is just a duplicate.\r\n\r\nLarlew: To continue using the old data file, create a blank DPSWarr character and save the xml, then open the new xml and your old one and compare them side-by-side. You will notice that there is a larger list of true/false arguments in the new one. Copy the new to old and save. Now you should be able to load the character into Rawr 2.2.11+\r\n",
