    "Description": "If you gear/gem to cap hit/exp it will show 0% avoided. If you gem/gear with Heroic presence to still cap, it will show .315% avoided attacks all under the Missed category (not factoring in the hit you gain from Heroic Presence). If you hover over the hit/exp areas on the Basic Stats it will properly tell you how much you are over the caps. Attached the xml so you can see.",
