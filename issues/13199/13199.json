      "Message": "I have looked at your character and I have not found that you have done anything wrong, so now I have to dig into the program and figure out why its not favouring hit as much as expected. My initial reaction would be that it thinks there is more dps to gain by using that gear than having a few spells missed, and if this is the case, you can set the spell hit rating >= the minimum you need to be at 100% spell hit, and optimize again.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will look into this in more detail and find out if anything can be improved in the model to make this make more sense. (Also I think the Embrace of the Spider trinket is valued higher than it should be.)",
