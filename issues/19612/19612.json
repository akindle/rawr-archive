    "Description": "There was a discussion about this some time ago and the end result was that an avoided attack is an avoided attack and it didn't matter if it was a dodge or miss.\nÂ \nNow though, our interrupt (Kitty) can miss and so I need to gear to meet the hit cap. Mobs cannot dodge or parry while casting, so the expertise cap is unnecessary. Kitty only has the \"avoided attacks\" as an option in the optimizer.",

      "Message": "Would I be correct in thinking that reforging is the best way to hit the cap due to giving up secondary stats rather than gemming where you would be (in most cases) giving up Agility (socket bonuses aside).    Just gonna have to re-do my gear in the meantime until the next version comes out.\r\n",
