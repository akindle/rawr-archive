Occassionally, I see a split second of lag while it does the calculation, which it doesn't do when changing other talents, but I don't see it lock up:\r\nNight Elf -> Dk -> TankDK -> Talents -> Climb the tree w/ tanking related talents until MoB.\r\n\r\nPlease post the character XML you have right before adding MoB and I'll look into it.",
