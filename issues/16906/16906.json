    "Description": "It would be really nice to add an option to enforce the optimizer to use at least 2 or 4 pieces of a given set.\nÂ \nFor example, as a warrior tank, I want to maintain the 4pc t10 set bonus, and have different pieces of non-set gear to choose among (like Pillars of Might, Badge gloves and chest etc). It would be cool to be able to specify how many pieces of set you want to maintain and let Rawr do the rest.",

      "Message": "That's a great kludge to do it, I hadn't thought of that.  It'd still be a nice feature to have though, particularly since the person might be wearing other items that have an associated cost.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to determine which 4 (or 2, or 2/2) pieces are best and set it so the system believes you only have those for that slot.  Again, kludged - I much prefer your method.",
