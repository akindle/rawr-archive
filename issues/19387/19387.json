    "Description": "After clearing caches and getting a fresh copy of the filters and items, I edited \"Somber Shawl\" along with some other gear to indicate that they were purchasable with justice points but the special currency filter was still not capturing them.   This appears to be due to the extra bar after \"dc\" in this rule:\n \nPurchasable with(?!.*(\\ds.*\\dc|))|(?<!PvP.*)...\n \nAfter removing the bar after dc, the items whose source is similar to \"Purchasable with 2200 [Justice Points]\" are now properly captured.",
