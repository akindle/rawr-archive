    "Description": "Loaded my mage up from Battle.net and, after stripping down all buffs excepting those I can't eliminate in game (Arcane Tactics and Toughness), I noticed that my stat percentages for haste and crit chance are inflated in Rawr compared with the Armoury.  (This only extends to the given percentages, the raw rating amounts given both in game and in Rawr agree.)  Attached the .xml below, but here are the stats in question:\n \nRawr\nHaste: 11.90% (1106 rating)\nCrit: 21.12% (488 rating)\n \nBattle.net\nHaste: 8.64% (1106 rating)\nCrit: 12.59% (488 rating)\n \nStR\n1. Load Battle.net armory.\n2. Search for Halrandir, level 85 mage on Elune server.\n3. Compare with .xml saved from Rawr today.\n \nRawr 4.0.17b (online)",

      "Message": "Which pane are you referring to?  I've never heard of the standard WoW UI having that factored in so I think you're referring to the Rawr stats pane.  But even if Rawr accounts for crit *depression* against a level 88 mob, that doesn't explain why it is reading *higher* than the standard WoW UI.  Crit depression would suggest a lower reading than on the Armoury, right?",

      "Message": "Kavan: Yup, the tooltip on my end does give the rating and equivalent % of the stats, but when I created that .xml I had turned off in Rawr all the buffs I can remove on my character (the only exceptions being Arcane Tactics and Toughness which are given by talents and a profession, respectively).  I just looked through the options tab at the Spells & Buffs section and disabled and unchecked everything I could, also setting \"Focus Magic Rate\" to 0.0.  This made the crit percentage given by Rawr lower to 15.44%, but this is still higher than that given by Battle.net.  The numbers for haste given by Rawr remained unchanged from all this mucking around I did.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I'm not seeing that I should be turning off in order to get my stats given by Rawr in line with those reported in game?  I know half/most of the point of this program is to extrapolate your character's performance in a real-world raiding or fighting situation and not purely in a vacuum, but I'd prefer to get down to the bare bones of my character in the simulator and build up from there so I have a better understanding on how those situations would inform my choices of gear and gear enhancements.",
