    "Description": "I have a lvl 80 BM and I just got a lot of new gear from ToGC and ICC 10 but when I run the optimizer it comes up with me gemming haste and Armor pen as a DPS increase. Hows that? BM's are already at the haste soft cap to begin with from talents, why would I need so much more? and armor pen for me? Wouldn't attack power or crit be better?\nÂ \nI have been using Rawr for along time now and lately it seems that as a BM it's hit or miss on optimizing.",

Since your current Meta doesn't really have problems with this and you aren't a JC isn't not a big deal, but good to have it checked regardless.\r\n- You might consider turning on the Hide Spell Gear and Hide PvP Gear options in the Basics tab of the Options Pane. This helps with making Build Upgrade List calculations (cutting out gear you'd probably never wear).\r\n- When I downloaded your file:\r\n- - Your Pet Talents were not set\r\n- - Your Shot Priorities were not set.\r\n- - You had not set any Buffs.\r\n- - You had not set any Pet Buffs.\r\n\r\nIf you can make these corrections and re-post the file I can take another look",
