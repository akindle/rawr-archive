    "Description": "Today, I played around a little bit with my cat gear in Rawr. Doing this, I noticed something rather odd when changing SoE totem from non-imp to imp. version: Enchant Ring - Stats went from 3.62 to 3.98 DPS, which seems rather high, since removing SoE alltogether, it just goes down by 0.04 dps.\nÂ \nSorry for my english -.-",

With Imp SoE, you're at a value of Str where adding a 4str enchant gives you 5str (from Kings). With Unimp SoE or no SoE, you're at a value of Str where adding a 4str enchant gives you meerly 4str.",
