    "Description": "Did a fresh item cache DL and some things jumped out as obviously bad since the last one I had:\n- Stormrider's Spaulders [359] [60289] in the default database have 3 green stats.  The mastery on them should be removed.  This moves them from BiS to not :P.\n- Poison Protocol Spaulders [359] [59120] have a 10 mastery socket bonus, default cache has none.\n- DMC:H is looking like 1 PPM as the correct model but I don't think the jury is in for sure on it yet.",
