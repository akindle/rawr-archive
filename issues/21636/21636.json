    "Description": "It appears there is some sort of error calculating crit rating for boomkin, which is forcing RAWR to prioritize crit over mastery.  As far as I know, crit is the weakest stat and should never be prioritized over mastery.  I've searched EJ and themoonkin\n repository this morning and was unable to find any information to the contrary.  I hope this helps and I certainly appreciate your program.",

      "Message": "While there are certainly some potential issues in 4.2.5 that have been resolved in the latest source (and thus will appear in the next release), you are incorrect in saying that crit should \"never\" be prioritized over mastery.  Crit and mastery are actually fairly close; in fact, when I derive a T12-Heroic BiS list using Rawr, crit and mastery are weighted exactly the same.  The fact is, as you get more of one stat (crit or mastery), the other actually becomes stronger.  This is what you are probably seeing, and it is by design.  SimulationCraft reports the same thing.",
