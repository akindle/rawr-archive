    "Description": "While I'm fairly good with remembering which items are what just from their names, I know scrolling through an item list would be much faster and easier on the eyes with icons.  In addition, I often use the \"Open in wowhead\" feature when you right click an item, but it's a hassle making sure I always click the correct feature when I really only right click an item for 1 reason every time.\nÂ \nMy suggestion is to have each item's icon in between its name and that bar to the right in the \"Comparisons\" area of Rawr.  In addition when you left click the icon, it'll open it in wowhead or armory, and right clicking the icon will let you select whether you prefer items opening in wowhead or armory.  This will make opening items much faster in addition to giving a little more life to the comparisons field.",
