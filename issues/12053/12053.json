    "Description": "I open my old save file (or load from armory), and T6 items my druid is wearing are equiped and calc'd (although I'm not sure how accurately - seems like the dps change when I swap gear is tied only to the base stats of the T6 gear as gemmed, and the set bonus doesn't seem to play a part anymore). However, the T6 items do not show up in the list of available gear, and isn't highlighted as currently equipped gear - so it's impossible to compare the T6 gear with anything else. If I flip to something else to see how it affects my dps, there is no way to go back to the T6 feral stuff originally equipped without reloading the save file (or character from armory). A bit disconcerting especially since previous versions of rawr show 2pc T6 set bonus as very valuable. Very strange bug.",
