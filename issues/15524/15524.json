    "Description": "I get the feeling that the Pet Dps is currently quite a bit too high. Have compared with the spreadsheet which has around 1200dps compared to 1800-1900 in Rawr.\nHave not been able to pinpoint yet where the difference comes from, but will see if I can narrow it down a bit.... with some tests and buff comparison.",
