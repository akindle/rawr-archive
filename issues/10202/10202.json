    "Description": "In Rawr.Bear, if you manage to compose a configuration(gear+buffs) where a tank is immune to melee (dodge + miss > 100%), the \"Mitigation Points\" value becomes negative. Probably the code computes that value with something like \"x/(1-(miss+dodge))\". There should be a check and something like \"Infinite\" should appear instead. It affects \"Overall Points\" and \"Damage taken\" too.",
