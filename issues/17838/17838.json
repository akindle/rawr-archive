    "Description": "I'm currently wearing 5pcT9 because it's the best gear available. My next purchase with Frost Emblems is going to be Blizzard Keeper's Mitts, which is an upgrade considering all stats (except hit, but i'm over the cap anyway). RAWR does not consider the Mitts an upgrade until i delete the set-text \"Nobundo's Regalia\" from the T9 gloves. This also lowers the T9 gloves' DPS from ~1200 to ~950. So i'm guessing the setbonus is somehow split among all five pieces even though it would still be active with the new non-set gloves. I attached my saved character, if anyone wants to have a look.",
