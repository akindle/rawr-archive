Crafted blues and blue quest rewards are rated higher than level 226+ epics?\n \nFor instance with neck pieces:\n \nChoker of the Betrayer: 49,31 (level 171 blue)\nEmerald Choker: 28,51 (level 200 blue)\nAmulet of Truesight: 21.06 (level 34!!!! blue)\nEvoker's Charm: 20,11 (level 226 epic)\n \nUnless I've seriously screwed up settings this must surely be a mistake. Upgrade XML attached.\n \nOnyx.",
