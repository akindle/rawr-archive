Short answer: no. Long answer: nooooooooooooooooooooooooo.\r\n\r\nRegardless of that answer, I might add it back in but it's not high on my prio list.\r\n\r\nGlyph of Eviscerate: The problem is not that the Glyph doesn't add damage, it's that Envenom is better than Eviscerate according to the optimizer, even for combat builds. You can see this for yourself by using Eviscerate in your custom rotation, checking/unchecking Glyph of Evis should then change your custom rotation DPS.\r\nWork in progress :)\r\n\r\nGlyph of Killing Spree: Killing Spree has not been implemented (yet).",
