It is currently providing a benefit of 1710 SP with a 50% uptime over the entire fight duration rather than only during the portion of the fight when the target is below 35%.",

I suspect that it's due to this code in MoonkinSolver.cs (which occurs prior to the code that calls Uptime for activated effects.:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        if (triggerChance > 0)\r\n                        {\r\n                            currentSpellPower += (proc.Effect.MaxStack > 1 ? proc.Effect.GetAverageStackSize(triggerInterval, triggerChance, 3.0f, calcs.FightLength * 60.0f) : 1) *\r\n                            proc.Effect.GetAverageUptime(triggerInterval, triggerChance, 3.0f, calcs.FightLength * 60.0f) * procSpellPower;\r\n                            currentCrit += (proc.Effect.MaxStack > 1 ? proc.Effect.GetAverageStackSize(triggerInterval, triggerChance, 3.0f, calcs.FightLength * 60.0f) : 1) *\r\n                                proc.Effect.GetAverageUptime(triggerInterval, triggerChance, 3.0f, calcs.FightLength * 60.0f) * procSpellCrit;\r\n                            currentMastery += (proc.Effect.MaxStack > 1 ? proc.Effect.GetAverageStackSize(triggerInterval, triggerChance, 3.0f, calcs.FightLength * 60.0f) : 1) *\r\n                                proc.Effect.GetAverageUptime(triggerInterval, triggerChance, 3.0f, calcs.FightLength * 60.0f) * procMastery;\r\n                        }\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, it appears that Sorrowsong does not count as an activated effect since it's proc does not appear in the activatedEffects array.",
