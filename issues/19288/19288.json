I did some work on the special effects parser that should have it working based on the rev. you mention.  \r\nWhich set of data do you have for it to pull from?  Debug or Release? (might be something in the release build or in your data set that isn't in mine)",

I've triied to build with the debug and release configuration with the same result.\r\nI'm not asking for a tutorial for building it correctly, so if you think it's related to my build, just close the issue and I'll try to be patient waiting for the next beta release !",
