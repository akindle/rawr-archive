    "Description": "When using the Update From Character Profile option, the glyphs for a character all become unchecked.  I'm not sure whether this is because CharacterProfiler does not have glyph information (which would surprise me, but I don't have access to my game machine at the moment) or whether Rawr is mishandling it somehow.  If the information is just absent from the saved variables file I'd personally prefer the existing state to remain unchanged, as currently I always have to remember to go in and add back the glyphs after an update.",
