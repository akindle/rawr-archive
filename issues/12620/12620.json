    "Description": "Using a laptop, it's highest setting is 1366x768 and the items on the 'bottom' of the character sheet are off the screen (really is a lovely laptop, no idea why they chose such an 'odd' resolution).  Should have some way to resize the whole thing or scroll down to it.  The weapon slots move 'up' but the wrist and 'extra socket' window do not, nor do the trinket slots.",
