      "Message": "I also ran into this problem, and it seems to be an interaction between enabling the +10% AP buffs and having a point in Trueshot Aura (not sure if this also affects other classes that bring the +10% AP buff)\r\n\r\nDisabling the buff for the Hunter and Pet in the XML file should allow it to work, or disabling the talent point.",

      "Message": "Thanks for the Reply,\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the Trueshot aura buff from my both myself and my pet, Rawr will no longer crash upon selecting MM.  (with 1 pt in the TSA talent)\r\n\r\nThis is still a relatively serious flaw however.  If you are specced in SV, but have TSA listed as a buff, and then try to use the Optimizer with talents selected, Rawr will crash.",

My hunter (and only the hunter) crashed within 30 secs or so fo use or if I started to optimise.  It took me a couple of goes to turn the True-Shot Aura buff for myself and pet (due to crashes) but since then everything has worked fine again.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",
