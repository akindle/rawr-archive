    "Description": "Right-clicking in Rawr (i.e. the diamond in the gear list) does not bring up any Rawr menus, instead bringing up a browser submenu (with \"Silverlight Preferences\" and \"Install Rawr onto this computer\"). Behavior seems erratic, I remember being able to use the right-click a couple of times in Safari, but subsequent trials have failed. Have never worked in Firefox. Installed Rawr on both machines also don't work.\n \nHome machine:\n \nMac OS 10.5.7\nSilverlight 3 (3.0.40818.0)\nSafari 3.2.3\nFirefox 3.5.3\n \nOffice machine:\n \nMac OS 10.5.4\nSilverlight 3 (3.0.40818.0)\nSafari 3.1.2 (5525.20.1)\nFirefox 3.0.14",
