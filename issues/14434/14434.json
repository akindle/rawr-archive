    "Description": "Creating an upgrade list takes a fairly large amount of time (at least if set on max thoroughness). The recent feature addition allowing you to remove an item manually from the list was a huge upgrade to this feature, but there is still more that can be done.\nÂ \nIf you were able to filter the upgrade list after it has finished running (ie sort for 10man gear or 25man gear) it would be alot faster and easier than sorting through the items 1 at a time to find a 10man drop i can pickup on a non-raid night.",
