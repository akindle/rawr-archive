    "Description": "In game physical damage reduction displayed as 74.86%, Rawr displays 72.43478%, despite having checked and rechecked that all items and enchants match.  This is ultimately a rather large variance.  Checking the displayed armor value in-game, it displays 31430, Rawr displays 31428, though the discrepancy there does not account for that of the mitigation value.",
