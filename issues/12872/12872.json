    "Description": "I was trying to model the value of \"Incanter's Absorption\" which says \"When you absorb damage your spell damage is increased by 15% of the amount absorbed for 10 sec.  Total spell damage increase cannot exceed 5% of your health.\"   However, the current mage model only includes the \"frequency\" of resistable/binary encounter effects, not their damage.   Thus, it doesnt look to me like you can actually simulate the value of Incanter's Absorption currently.   \nÂ \nDid I miss something?",

      "Message": "No currently it's not able to model it. The resistable/binary effects is used to model magic absorption. For incanter's absorption we would need data on incoming damage, not just dps but frequency and damage spread and some way of specifying how you're receiving shields. You also have to take into account that some damage needs preemtive shielding to take effect of it and some that's more spreadout like dots can be reactive. If you have any suggestions on how to model this in terms of specification of these parameters I can see about implementing such a model.",

Then modify the damage amount by resistance scores and clip by max absorb value and use that is input for incanter's absorption. Would something like that work?\r\n\r\nIt feels like this should be combined somehow with the incoming damage profile for survivability, but I don't have a good idea how to do that yet. Basically the only thing that survivability profile is missing is the frequency, it just uses a general granularity that affects all types of damage at the same time. Maybe if that is changed so that effect frequency from effect tab is moved to a new frequency column for survivability we can use the same profile for both purposes.",

      "Message": "Yeah, that's very similar to what I meant and probably better.  I do think it's worth looking at the incoming damage profile stuff as well.  Since youre calling them \"profiles\", it might be worthwhile to have several of them pregenerated that we could \"select\" that match the current characteristics of known boss fights.  That way you could tune your gear versus particular encounters -- very useful if you use a gear mode (or Blizz's) to swap armor/weapon/(maybe talent specs).\r\n",
