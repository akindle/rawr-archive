    "Description": "I am currently using Rawr v2.2.24 and I noticed a bug for the \"Available for Optimizer\" function. It told me to put a red gem into the yellow slot of my \"Furious Gladiator's Boots of Triumph\" to improve my DPS. This is physically impossible game play wise. I have included a screen shot of the \"optimizer recommendation\".\nÂ \n~Fangz (Bloodguzzler, lv 80 Rogue, Nazgrel US)",

But otherwise, mix and match to your heart content.\r\n\r\nMany tanks stack BLUE +STA gems on every socket they can get ahold of.\r\nI've seen Rogues and Hunters stack +AGI.",
