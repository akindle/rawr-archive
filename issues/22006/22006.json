    "Description": "The export function is not accurate for attack power and spell power. When you load a character from armory and export the stats via \"Export Stats to Enhsim config file\", all stats and ratings are accurate but AP and SP (e.g. the paperdoll stats ingame show 15787 AP and 8683 SP for me, but the exported config file shows 14474 AP and 7383 SP).\nEdit: Just to clarify the issue: Enhsim needs the ingame paperdoll stats to work properly. That means RAWR has to copy AP and SP after applying Unleashed Rage. Seems like RAWR is only applying 10% bonus AP by unleashed rage, not 20%.\nEdit2: I think there's something wrong in EnhSim.cs in lines 75, 76 and 81. I'm not a programmer but I think it should be\n75:                case 1: unleashedRage = .10f; break;\n76:                case 2: unleashedRage = .20f; break;\n81:            float MQUnleashedRageSpellpower = stats.AttackPower * (1f + unleashedRage) * 0.55f;\n82:            sb.AppendLine(\"spellpower                      \" + MQUnleashedRageSpellpower.ToString(\"F0\", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));\nto reflect 4.3 changes.\nEdit3: After changing these lines, AP seems better (difference between export and ingame sheet is now 3 AP). SP is still missing about 500 points,\nEdit4: Changed another line, works now (except for rounding errors). See source code posted above. I submit the EnhSim.cs file.",
