    "Description": "In the attached profile for my shadow priest, the necks \"Evoker's Charm\" and \"Love's Prisoner\" both show as zero DPS.   If you de-select \"Bloodlust/Heroism\" or \"Improved Moonkin form\" in the buffs then suddenly they show as an upgrade.\n \nSimilarly, the waist \"Braid of Salt and Fire\" gains 270 dps in value by turning off Imp.Moonkin and a whopping 665 dps by turning off Bloodlust.\n \nFunnily enough, the RSV's for haste and crit don't change more than you would expect by turning these buffs on or off.",

I've tried to make this issue go away entirely, but the cost in speed is too great.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can try to tweak your Brain/Ping lag slider in order to solve some of this problem. (I do this all the time)\r\n\r\n",
