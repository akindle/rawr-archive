    "Description": "When I try to import my charecter \"kossafix\" from character profiler it looks as if Rawr can't parse the values for the talent \"nature's majesty\" and sets it to 0/2 even though I have other talents depending on this. Since the talent is set as 0/2 while I have talents set that depends on it, it also locks me from manually clear the tree  and set my talants manually.\n \nThe same problem was also present in 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 but then I could circumvent the problem by reloading my character form armory, but now this isn't possible since that clears all gear selection that the character profiler made in the previous step... (I saw that there was an issue for that also...)\n \nI include my character profile file....\n \nKeep up the good work!",
