    "Description": "I know it's a new thing that warrior's can use 1h weapons but rawr isn't showing me any 1h weapons, and when I import my warrior from the armory the Improvements I see are only 2h weapons and on the off hand, it only shows mages stuff.\n \nAlso if I go on the right bar and choose Gear>Offhand I get this error: \n \n[Arg_ArgumentException]\nArguments: \nDebugging resource strings are unavailable.

      "Message": "Ok nvm, investigated and found this was three separate things:\r\n\r\n1) You need to go to Filters by Item Type and turn on 1h Weapons then click Apply. DPSWarr by default doesn't show them but does leave you the option to turn them on.\r\n2) SMT wasn't handled correctly. I've fixed this\r\n3) Having a 1h in the OffHand is throwing a NaN on that chart, so it ends up not knowing what to do and crashes. I've added a handler to check for NaN in that core file so no models can make that break anymore.",
