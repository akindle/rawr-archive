    "Description": "An user story:\n \nI have a Hunter, and itens with strenght and spell power don't matter to me. Dodge Rating is also useless since I don't tank, nor heal, only Ranged DPS.\nRawr is showing itens meant for tanks, and caster classes, and all those itens heavily increase the time optimization takes to finish. Rawr shouldn't try to check for 50000 itens if only 500 of them are useable to me.\n \nThere might be problems with some itens with mixed stats. While I'd like to disable spell crit, some meta gens have normal crit, so it shouldn't be filtered. Trinkets could be a difficult corner case, if you can't do the filtering by slot item(which could lead to unifying the filtering in \"Refine types of itens listed\" and Filters itself.\n \nWith that many options, it could get really complex, maybe the ability to save/load filtering profiles and having preset profiles would help.",
