We've fixed those cases, that I know of, but keep in mind that there may still be some, and we really have to fix them if we make the status form uncloseable. ",

If that doesn't get called, even if the status box can close, the app is still in an unusable state, so either way we need to catch any instance where that function doesn't get called after the background workers complete.",

      "Message": "another option (aside from that function needing to be called regardless) is to allow the status box to close, and use a status bar on the bottom of the form to continue to update the user as to progress (and allow them to open the status form again from there), like outlook does with regards to its progress indicator.  This was the quick and dirty solution, that is the better solution in my mind.  I was going to work on that tomorrow probably.",
