    "Description": "It would be really nice if the Direct Upgrade and optimized Upgrade List could show the model-defined subpoints instead of just the sum.\nÂ \nA lot of times I want to know /why/ something is an upgrade. Especially for tank models (I'd rather have a smaller survival/mitigation upgrade than a larger threat upgrade, for example). Also, some other models (/looks at Enhance and RestoSham >.>) don't let you nullify Survivability or have a \"Burst\" subpoint and expect you to just sort everything by DPS/Sustained value, which is annoying and renders the upgrade list features effectively useless as the upgrade value is fuged by the survival/burst value, wich can sometimes be /huge/, in the case of burst.",

      "Message": "Think about what you're asking, and re-read what I said; I'm guessing you misunderstood. \r\n\r\nIt's true that our charts do at least support negative values, but unless it's either all negative or all posative, there's no way to visually tell where the overall value is. This would be extremely confusing for almost all users. A bar that visually shows a Survivability of 300 and a Mitigation of 200, for a Total of 500 is easy. It's just a bar that's 500pixels long, with the first 300 of it shaded blue, and the rest (200) shaded red. But a bar that shows a Survivability of 500, and a Mitigation of -100, for a Total of 400... Not so easy. What does that look like? There's no immediately obvious answer to that (that I know of anyway), so it's a situation we try to avoid where possible.  ",
