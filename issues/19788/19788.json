    "Description": "It would be nice if for instance I was using an XML I loaded it automatically saved to that file again by default.   Would require the addition of a \"save as......\" option in the menu.    This would bring it into line with most other windows programs and how they handle saved documents/pictures etc..\n \nI live in fear of accidently saving my resto file to my feral file and having to re-enter all my feral stuff again.\n \nAlso, I think it may not be possible with the browser version,  but a reminder to save on closing would be nice as well.    At the moment, you close your browser window and there is no reminder you haven't saved or dialog saying are you sure.....    When I wake up at my PC at 3am and shut everything down, it is very easy to not think about whether I have saved or not and just shut it down and lose a nights upgrades :)",
