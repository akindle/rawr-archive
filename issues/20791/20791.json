    "Description": "I was wondering why my expertise in raw (silverlight version on ej) is lower than in armory. Rawr says that bracers, gloves and belt are not reforged, but they are (see armory). I tried to import the char from battle.net serveral times yesterday and today, \n \nSame results.  Rawr does not import the reforging of this 3 items.\n \nChar: Sahkyo on: EU Nozdormu",
