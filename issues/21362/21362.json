    "Description": "While I realize the Hunter module is not yet supported, it remains useful for some gemming, enchanting, and gear selection activity.  While it still works fine in 4.2.3, it creates an error message in 4.2.4 that results in an infinite loop on the error message, which is attached, and forces an abend of RAWR and reload of the software.  Would appreciate a fix to this so one can still use in the context stated.  Thank you.",
