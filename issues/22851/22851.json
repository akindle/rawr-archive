    "Description": "I have downloaded two files: first file was from Curse with the label of Rawr WPF4.3.8 and the other folder titled Rawr.  I have also downloaded Microsoft Silverlight Version: 5.1.10411.0.  I simply can not find where to open the program in either of the Rawr file folders!  Can you give me some advise to help me?  I have attached a screenshot of both folders and the files they contain.",
