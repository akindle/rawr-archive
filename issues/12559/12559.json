    "Description": "I spotted something very strange (at least to me) in the Druide Tree model. It values \"Redeemer's Alchemist Stone\" (SP: 63; 40%+ on selfused potions) higher than \"The Egg of Mortal Essence\" (SP: 98; proc 505 Haste). Even if you ignore the chance for haste proc (which happens quite often for me) I can not understand how the +35 Spellpower would not make the Egg more preferable. Especially since you can use potions only once during a boss fight. I tried all different \"Spell Usage\" under Figth details, but doesnt make a difference in Rawr's preference for the stone.\n \nIs this a flaw in the model or in my understanding.",

      "Message": "Maybe this helps:\r\n\r\nthe model assumes you are using every opportunity to cast and that you're having no latency problems. The default fight length is 5 minutes, which you will only have in raids. The default rotation is chaincasting regrowth on a different players while keeping up rejuv and lifebloom on 1 tank.\r\n\r\nObviously, in many fights we don't chaincast. Sometimes there's heavy healing. Often, we just keep that lifebloom up on the tank when there is enough healing. What do you think, if you would be chaincasting your heals all the time, would you go out of mana? (I think I would)\r\n\r\nThe best way to deal with this issue right now is changing the length of the fight (make it much shorter so you won't go out of mana according to the calculation)\r\n\r\nI'm considering adding a slider bar that can let you lower the time% spent casting the primary heal outside refreshing tank hots.",

Being told I am going to go OOM in less than 2 minutes, always upset me, since I tend to end many fights with nearly full mana (or an unused innervate) due to hanging back and only casting when neccesary. \r\n\r\n",
