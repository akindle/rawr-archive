    "Description": "RAWR is calculating total avoidance (miss+dodge+parry+block) until 100% only, but the correct is 102,4% for raid bosses (it seems it is not taking into account the level difference). I checked the boss level config and it is set at 88.\n   If I respec/regem/enchant as RAWR points out, some avoidance will be missing.",
