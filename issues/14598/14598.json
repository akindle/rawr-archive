    "Description": "DESC #1: I'd like to be able to perform a quick inquiry that tells me which instance would have the most possible upgrades in it e.g. Ulduar 25 would have 3 but Ulduar 10 only 1 and hence I'd run 25 more often than 10.\nHOW?: Add an option to Filters to Uncheck them all. Then I can check Ulduar 25. Uncheck 25 and check 10 to compare.\nAVAIL: I can do this at present except I have to uncheck 15-odd items to clear the list first. (Yes I'm lazy, but it would be nice no?)\nDESC #2: Related. Have the above available in Upgrade Lists as well as RAWR Core.\nNOTES: This would also quickly allow a query asking \"What can crafting alone provide?\", or \"What can I get from Emblems?\"\nUPDATE: Just realised that RAWR Core would need to be amended to allow Slot Gear to have the ALL option as it does in Upgrade Lists.",
