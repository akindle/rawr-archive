    "Description": "I've just started using Rawr and let me tell you guys that it's AWESOME, but I'm having a small issue. When I try to use the optimization option my character gets worse on stats and overall score. I've set up all the gemming templates and enchants to what I currently use, but still I'm loosing stats when I try to optimize. I've attached my character file for you to look at and see If you find something wrong. Thanks!!",
