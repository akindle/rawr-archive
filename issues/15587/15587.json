    "Description": "I am unable to filter for items that require multiple items.\nThe problem is I can only filter for one string.\nAs it reads for item number 48165 (Malfurion's Trousers of Triumph): The users source is reported as \"Purchasable with 75 [Emblem of Triumph] and 1 [Trophy of the Crusade]\". This can be filtered with no problems. Unfortunately the actual data being filtered seems to be reported as two separate strings and reads as fallows:\n \nPurchasable with 75 [Emblem of Triumph]\nPurchasable with 1 [Trophy of the Crusade]\n \nAny filter I apply only reflects one string or the other, with no way to filter them together.\n \nEither the String needs to be one string to filter it easier, or I need to know how to filter for two strings.",
