These items are Unique-Equipped (3) across all of them.\nFor example you can have any 3 total: Runed Dragon's Eye, Smooth Dragon's Eye and/or Quick Dragon's Eye equipped.\nCurrently, rawr is not enforcing this restriction in selecting & gemming gear.",

Here we would have to physically restrict equipping items. The easiest way I see to handle this would be to have an indicator somewhere that warns you if you have too many jewelcrafters gems equipped.",

      "Message": "It would be good even if just the list of items to compare on the right was filtered based on the prismatic gem limit.  So if you had 3 equipped, all items with any prismatic gems would be filtered out.  If you only had 2, all items with more than 1 prismatic gem get filtered.  The tricky part comes in when you're comparing against one of your existing items that has prismatics, then the list would only be filtered if somehow you're ending up with 4+ after swapping your existing item.",
