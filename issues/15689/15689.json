    "ClosedComment": "Closed - because I am tired of repeating myself to the stupid people out there that think 2.3.5 &#40;and higher is broken&#41;, when in fact the calculations are 100&#37; correct for the very first time. Simply install the DrDamage addon and you will see that the ingame results matches 2.3.5 &#40;and higher&#41;, while 2.3.4 is completely and utterly broken. All that is missing is the pets, and certain buff mechanics - thats why the damage result is lower - but the actual rating of gear is now more correct than it ever was in 2.3.4.You only think that 2.3.4 is &#39;working&#39; because it has pets &#40;and a working &#39;events&#39; tab, but the rest of 2.3.4 is so wrong that if you&#39;re using it for your loot decisions, well then you only have yourself to blame for your crap ingame dps.",
