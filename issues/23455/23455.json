    "Description": "Currently, editing talents causes a full recalc per talent change: this can take a while over the course of [6 removed talents + 6 added talents], and can be confusing given that Rawr apparently queues up mouse click events and processes them sequentially (turning the cursor to 'thinking mode' 6-12 times in a row).\n\nMy suggestion would be to add a 'Confirm these talents' button, which would be the only thing causing a talent-based recalc, allowing the user to tick/untick any number of talent beforehand without associated latency.",
