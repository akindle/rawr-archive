    "Description": "I hope this is the right spot to post this. \n \nThe robe my character has as well as a ring have an \"of the...\" modifier to them. Rawr ignores this and in the case of the robe reports generic armor stats. In the case of the ring it reports that armory can't find the item.\n \nSpecifically, I'm wearing Baradin Robe of the Wildfire and have a Jasper Ring of the Fireflash. \n \nI apologize if this is a known issue, but searching through the issue tracking forum didn't seem to turn anything up, but then again it's hard to search on a term like this.",
