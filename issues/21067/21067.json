    "Description": "I am attempting to install RAWR 4.2.  I have unzipped the file but when I click on the RAWR.WPF file, nothing happens.  The circle (hour glass) thing comes up to indicate the computer is running something for about 20seconds and then goes away and no install occurs.  I have attempted to down load a second time and the same thing happens.  I am running W64 and my windows up date is current.  Can anyone help me figure this out?  THanks.",
