    "Description": "It appears that druid.tree is not yet implemented.  This is perfectly understandable, and clearly listed in the model status page.\n \nHowever, it takes a while to find that page, and the indication that its not implemented in the app is pretty subtle - you select it, but \"nothing happens\" : the model indicator at the bottom right doesn't change.  It appears to be \"buglike\" instead of intentional. At least, it took me a bit to figure out what was going on.\n \nCan I suggest that the menu be disabled and a not-yet-implemented tag be added to those models that don't exist, like in import menu?",
