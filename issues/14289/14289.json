    "Description": "After adding the items to the item database, I attempted to use them, but they would not show up in the list. This happened for other items I tried to add too, but they were added to the static database as of the last release of Rawr so it didn't matter to me.\nÂ \nI imported them through the armory with their item ID (47545 and 47546). First thing I noticed after being unable to pick the item was that the armory did not list the socket bonus so I grabbed the socket bonus through mmo-champion which was listed as 8 attack power, the items still did not work after adding the socket bonus so now I am stumped.",
