    "Description": "Since DK Tanks are very CD dependent, the only reasonable way to integrate their CDs into their rotation is to move them from a % uptime model to an integration with shot rotation.  Also to include other trinket activations over the duration of a longer fight.  I'm not sure if the ProtWarr/ProtPaly/ProtDruid stuff works this way, but I've seen it for the healer models to help them manage mana regen and such.  \nÂ \nThis way I can include Anti-Magic Shell for magic-heavy fights, and we can get a better sense for Unholy vs. Frost vs. Blood tanks based on talents.  (Someone may have 2 tanking specs one for heavy physical fights, and one that includes Anti-magic sphere for magic heavy fights.",
