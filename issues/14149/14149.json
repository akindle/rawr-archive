    "Description": "I downloaded the latest version of rawr this morning (2.2.16). Other characters load fine, but I am having trouble with warrior characters. When I try to load them from the armory, the armory information seems to download ok, but then when rawr tries to open the character an error message comes up saying 'rawr has stopped working' and rawr then closes itself.\n \nI have tried this with 2 warriors from my guild, and the results were the same with both.\n \nCharacter details are:-\n \nName: Tonka Realm: Nagrand EU\n \nName: Dum Realm: As above.\n \nI'd be grateful if you could look at this for me, thanks.",

We just changed that Buff's name because it was no longer valid. The replacement is called Renewed Hope. I fixed that line in my build and it worked fine after that.",
