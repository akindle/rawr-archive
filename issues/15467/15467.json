    "Description": "Thanks for a good program. I have a problem getting optimization to give me def cap results.\n \nI use rawr ver 2.3.2 and is a prot warrior, under target lvl in option panel have i choosed 83.\nI have under optimazion added a rule that % chance to be crit has to be =<0\n \nBefore I ran the optimization my defence was 539, and after it dropped to 529.\nIn both cases it says my change to be crit is 0.00% \nIf i hover the mouse over i se the number chance to crit reduzed by 5.07 and before I ran optimzation it was 5.47\n \nHow do i get get my def cap to be 535 (change to  crit reduzed by 5,40) fighting in heroic dungeons, and 540 (reduzed by5,60) if I tank in raids\n \nFile attached after optimation has been run",
