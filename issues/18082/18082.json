      "Message": "Using posted toon, the -183 dps is constant on the talent page regardless of points spent in serrated blades, however overall DPS does go down by that amount. Also Stats page shows an increase in Armor Mitig. and Rupture damage (as expected) but overall dps decreases.\r\n\r\nOn another note, while looking into possible causes Armor mitigation decreases with Sunder Armor/Expose Armor (20% Armor Decrease) by about 3-5% which seemed strange.",

      "Message": "The armorpen would be correct in a way.     If you had 80% ArPen, then without sunder you are mitigating 80% of the full armor amount.    If you add sunder then you are mitigating 80% of 80% of the mobs armor ie.   64% of the full armor amount.      Over all, you are now mitigating 84% of the mobs armor, but the amount of armor your actual ArPen reduces does drop a little.\r\n\r\nAt least that is my understanding of how it all works.   More than happy to be shown otherwise.\r\n\r\n",
