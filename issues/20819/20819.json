    "Description": "On certain combinations of gear, the stat values for Arcane seem to be all messed up, to get back to normal after reforging a single item. In this example, the value of haste suddenly went all the way up, while I can't give any explanation for this myself, as there are no dots and therefore no haste plateaus. Is this a bug or just something I'm not aware of?\nÂ \nedit: quitting the program and reloading the file, the values went back to normal. Since it gets a bit hard to check what's causing it, this ticket can be closed/deleted. There are some strange things happening though, such as Crit getting a negative value, or Rawr suggesting that reforging mastery to hit is better than crit to hit even though mastery's value is higher. Again, not really reproducable, so never mind I guess.",

I've been making some improvements to the stability so it'll be interesting to see if you notice any difference in the next version. In any case if you're able to find a reproducible case I'd be very interested in getting the xml for it.",
