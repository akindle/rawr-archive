Only suggestion I can come up with is to temporarily change your idol to mutilation and see if that work. Also try starting a new file and see if it persists with that.",

      "Message": "Hinalover, are you looking at the comparison chart?  Given the file, that's the only place I am finding Rimetooth Pendant [264] is higher than Rimetooth Pendant [251].\r\n\r\nAlso of note, she is optimizing for DPS Rating.\r\n\r\nI have Solitha's Rawr 2.3.21 (she uses it from a thumb drive) and my recently-compiled 2.3.21+ side by side and am getting the same results, so it's not an item cache issue.\r\n\r\nThe file she uploaded has a DPS rating of 15301.  Evaluating upgrade for the [264] pendant brings her to 15355.  Evaluating for the [251] pendant brings her to 15370.  However, optimizing with just the [264] available found a 15448 that was not found when optimizing with both the [264] and the [251] available.\r\n\r\nThis may be a case of the disclaimer in the optimizer options: \"Even at maximum thoroughness, finding the best possible gearset is not guaranteed, just very likely.\"  This is probably just one of those few cases the best possible gearset wasn't found.",
