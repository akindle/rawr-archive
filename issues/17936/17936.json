    "Description": "1. Thx 4 rawr, love it.\n2. sorry for bad english\n3. Me, as a Rogue playing hc inis and raids, wants expertise to be capped,\neven if it costs me some dps in the calculation.\nAtm there is no possibility to lock certain stats. Only thing i can do\nis to add \"avoided white attacks <= 0\" or sth close to 0.\nThis results in millions  of dps and is already reportet.\non the other hand i dont know if \"avoided white attacks <= X\" would grant me \n26 expertise /132 expertise rating.\nI hope it is possible 4 you to implement such a feature\n\"gem for dps, but stat x and y must be minimum z\"\nThx 4 your good work, keep up :)\n \nps: i know you calculate the max dps and even with expertise not capped i am able to do lots of dps,\nbut ... i want it to cap. had lots of rotations broken by not gaining enough energy duo a lack pf expertise.\n \nThx, \nAlex",

White attacks are different in that they can miss more.",
