    "Description": "In the new Rawr 2.2.25, enhancement shammys mainhand weapon preference seems to be incorrect.\n \nIt prefers the MH to be fast and the offhand to be slow, however this is a substantial change from prior versions (even 2.2.24 preferred a slow MH weapon). I also don't expect a fast MH weapon to be any good due to Windfury procs getting more value from a slow MH, so I'm wondering if somebody accidentally did something wrong to the windfury calculation - such as removing the internal cooldown. Just a guess, because if you have a look lower on the Stats page you can see the Windfury Attack go from ~950dps to ~1700 after the weapon change.\n \nTo reproduce:\n1. Load up \"Hoofee\" from the realm \"Dath'Remar\" (US Server)\n2. Take note of the dps (and also Windfury Attack dps lower on the stats page).\n3. Click the MH weapon and select another weapon (you will notice many fast MH weapons at the top of the list).\n4. Notice the huge increase in dps.",
