    "Description": "I've tried with several different gem combinations (all within rawr, not changing my real character of course).  The optimizer repeatedly recommends gem changes that it computes to a LOWER overall score.  It seems to have a preference for pure +spell if you initally have something other than pure +spell gems (e.g., +int or +spell+int).  But if I try replacing those gems with the recommended pure +spell and re-run the optimizer, then it again \"optimizes\" to an even lower score - now preferring +spell+spirit gems.  I attach one sample. You can't see the gem recommendations, I don't know how to make those show except by individual mouseover, but the before and after scores are obvious.  I got the identical results with both the genetic and simulated annealing algorithms.",

      "Message": "I searched for \"lower score\" and found 4 posts, generally concerned with lower dps - not the score I'm concerned with. I just tried the optimizer again, this time reloading from armory where my character indeed has the relevant items/gems equipped and verified the max thoroughness setting.  The before vs. after scores again went down.  The gems it wanted to change from the real gemmings were: head spell/hit -> spell, shoulder spell/int -> spell, chest spell/int -> spell, waist hit -> spell, pants spell/int -> spell, feet spell -> spell/spirit. This is all wrt version 2.2.19, which I believe is the latest.   Thanks.",

I did nothing else. I still got exactly the same result as before, with score before optimization about 110 points higher than after.  I had previously set the throughness to maximum, and apparently that's \"sticky\".  The calculation to optimize was Overall Rating on top left hand side. None of the radio boxes on right hand side were clicked.  NO \"additional requirements\", and I  did not click the Build Upgrades List. v2.2.19.",
