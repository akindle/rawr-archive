      "Message": "Hmm, I apologize, I was mistaken, just looked it up and Soul Fire does not have a cooldown either, so currently soul fire and shadowbolt/incinerate cannot be used in the same priority list. I assume you want it to only use soul fire when decimation procs? The problem with implementing such a mechanic (similar problem to drain soul/deaths embrace) is that I don't believe we can accurately determine what percent of the time the boss is below 35% (not just simply 35% of the time; as these execute abilities make the last portion of a boss last shorter than the start). If I get some time I may work on implementing a method of using decimation procs though (possibly a check box or something) and a slider for % time below 35%.",
