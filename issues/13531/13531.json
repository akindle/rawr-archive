    "Description": "I am trying to setup optimization for my Moonkin and I am setting the following parameters/buffs:\nImproved Moonkin Form\nArcane Intellect\nVampiric Touch\nImproved Blessing of Wisdom\nMoonkin Form\nTotem of Wrath\nDivine Spirit\nImproved Power Word: Fortitude\nBlessing of Kings\nFaerie Fire\nEarth and Moon\nImproved Faerie Fire\nFlask of the Frost Wyrm\nPotion of Speed\nSpell Power Food\nT7 (25 man) 2 piece set bonus\nÂ \nOptions:\nTarget level 83\nLatency 0.2\nEst. Fight Time(min.) 9\nCaster Innervate on Self\nInnervate Delay 4\nEclipse Type: Lunar\n100% moonfire uptime\nRotation: IS/MF/W\nI have currently equiped 3 Dragon Eye one and one +23 spell power gem. After running optimization it is saying I will go from 7321.093 score to 7242.232 score by replacing these gems with +19 spell power gems. This is optimizing for overall rating. When I run it for sustained DPS it is saying add the Spirit/Spell power gems instead of a Dragon's Eye or the unique gem. \nIf the optimizer is wrong is the item wish list wrong as well?",
