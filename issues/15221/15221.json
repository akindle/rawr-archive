    "Description": "Currently using change-set 43290.\nÂ \nMy problem:  I load in my character .xml and look at my stats.  There I am sitting at 168 expertise rating (28 above the 140 expertise dodge \"cap\").  Now, i recently received a new weapon from Anub, so I select that as available and go to do an optimize.  After the optimizer is finished, it has removed three of my expertise gems and changed my ulduar mace with expertise to the new weapon.  This results in a loss of \"20*3+29=89\" expertise rating.  So I should be at 79 expertise rating.  However, Rawr is showing as having 140 expertise rating.  Doing an export to Enhsim, it is showing me correctly at 79 expertise rating.\nI have no constraints set for optimizing.  I have the override regem/reenchant, the flasks/elixers, mixology, food and talent specs boxes checked.",

Override is not something that is normally selected, it's only really used when you want to optimiser to ignore your choices.\r\n\r\nSo it picked Flask of Expertise (45 expertise) and Mixology buff (16 expertise) and got 61 expertise - with the 79 you had equipped it got to 140 expertise - perfectly on cap.
