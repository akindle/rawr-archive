    "Description": "Description: When i add grounded plasma shield to my Rawr simulation (after previously having no tinker in place) my mitigation drops from 724845 to 362493. Either i am completely mis-understanding the way the simulation works or there is an issue as surely any reduction in damage taken should result in higher mitigation? I have searched everywhere on EJ and here and cannot find it mentioned, although i'm sure someone must know what's happening.\n \nEJ deleted my post and accused me of 'begging' for information and were of no help, so i'm now trying to post here in an effort to understand.\n \nAdditional Information:\n \n    * Rawr v4.0.20.0b\n    * Windows 7",
