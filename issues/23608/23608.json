    "Description": "When using this \"Copy to Clipboard\" functionality, the Item Upgrades list is bundled up *twice*, meaning that the resulting CSV data in Clipboard Memory has twice as many rows as expected, half of which are redundant.\n\nNote that the first row, Name/Equipped/Slot/Gem1/.../DPS, is not duplicated.  So there are only (N-1)/2 duplicate rows.",
