I haven&#39;t found any case so far where Arcane Light would produce suboptimal results so there should be no disadvantage from doing this, only better performance. If you want to do more advanced analysis with all possible cycles I would suggest to use cooldown segmentation.",

      "Message": "Somehow this specific gear setting triggers some very bad conditions for the arcane solver. I'm not sure if I'll be able to fix it, but there is a workaround. I would suggest you either select Arcane Light option under advanced setting or check Disable Mana Regen Cycles under Spells & Buffs. Either of those should fix your problem. In addition I would suggest to keep Max Use Assumption checked under advanced options.",
