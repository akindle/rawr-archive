    "Description": "I haven't had much time to play with it yet, but, even with a brief attempt, I encountered the following problems:\n \nWhen loading the attached Rawr2 generated character (.xml) file using Safari Version 4.0.3 (5531.9) under Mac OS X Version 10.5.8, Safari either crashes and closes on load (four times), or loads, then crashes and closes on mouseover (twice).  Same character (Rhianwyn@Cenarion Circle, L80 balance druid) loads from Armory fine, except no item socket bonuses are shown; however, I should note that the ITEMS from the aborted file load now all appear to be in the cache, although not marked as available (with diamonds).\n \nUnder Firefox 3 (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4), the attached file loads, and can be manipulated, but no items show a socket bonus.  (Are importing socket bonuses an as-yet unimplemented feature, although the item editor allows putting them in?)\n \nOther first impressions: \n  o  Interface is cleaner, and MUCH more responsive than the standalone, particularly pull-down menus, especially with WoW running.  Trying to run both the old standalone Rawr2 and WoW at once (either on my Windows XP SP3 bootcamp install, or with WoW running under OS X and Rawr2 running under Parallels/Win XP from the same install, resulted in a noticeable slowdown on both programs.\n  o  Some UI elements, particularly gem graphics in the item popups, seemed somewhat slow loading and took several mouseovers before they would show correctly and consistantly.\n  o  Really, REALLY missing the 'Reload Current Character from Armory' menu function (not yet implemented), probably one of my more used commands in the program (the easiest way to bring in new items marked as available without unmarking the old ones).\n  o  Is there some way of accessing a master item cache yet like Rawr2 had for evaluating potential upgrades (other than loading a fresh character or entering them by hand), that I'm missing, or is that a not-yet-implemented feature?\n \nLike it so far.\n \nRhianwyn/Redwuff\n \nMy main system:\n \n  Model Name:\tMacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro4,1\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:\t2.6 GHz\n  Number Of Processors:\t1\n  Total Number Of Cores:\t2\n  L2 Cache:\t6 MB\n  Memory:\t4 GB  667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n  Bus Speed:\t800 MHz\n  Boot ROM Version:\tMBP41.00C1.B03\n  SMC Version (system):\t1.28f2\n \n  Video: GeForce 8600M GT, 512MB vram, running at 1920x1200 32 bit\n \n  System Version:\tMac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a)\n  Kernel Version:\tDarwin 9.8.0\n \n  Safari and Firefox3 versions listed above.
