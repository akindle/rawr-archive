    "Description": "Rawr says I should be doing 47k, xml located at: http://pastebin.com/GvYr7f6p\nI am not aware of why it says I should be doing 47k, sorry.\nÂ \nRecklessness tooltip is incorrect/not up to date (and value of dps given by selecting it seems pretty low, but could be right - unsure)\nInner Rage tooltip also incorrect, reduce CD on Cleave/HS to 1.5s for 15 sec on 30 sec cooldown...timing use of it could be hard, I suppose that's why it's not modeled yet...\nTypo in Berserker Rage tooltip (tage)\nSwitching tabs in Instructions tab makes tabs and parent tabs disappear",
