    "Description": "I'm capped at 70 - no wrath yet, and will be doing BC raids/instances for a while.  I downloaded your program and am having issues trying to filter out everything but BC gear.  When I use the BC filter, it's only displaying gear that I am currently wearing.  No upgrades.  What can I do to acheive what I want to achieve here, which is to get a list of gear upgrades that doesn't include anything beyond BC raids?",
