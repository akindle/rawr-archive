    "ClosedComment": "Changed issue to suggest that data loaded from profile and/or armory implements these tick boxes rather than relying on the user having to remember to manually tick them every time they load character.\n\nI follow philosophy in programming that if the program has access to the data and can easily implement something automatically that you shouldn't rely on the user to remember to do something for the data to be accurate.",

    "Description": "The base stats values for all of the models are incorrect when character has mining (+ stamina bonus) or skinning (+crit rating bonus). The value of the bonus is dependant on the level of those professions. This would be best dealt with I think in the parse for loading character data (from armory or profiler). This would then mimic the Blizzard Character Sheet where the bonus is treated as part of the base stats.",
