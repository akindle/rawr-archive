    "Description": "For now, many items do not have information on where they drop, so the best way for me to filter out heroic raid loot would be to disable ilvl 372+ gear. At the moment using the \"Disable by Item Level\" filters would also eliminate all 359 raid gear, since the available 359-378 range is too large. As a workaround until the item database can be completed, having 359-371 and 372-378 (or just change 379+ to 372+) options would be more useful. (I see that there are plans to implement manual entry of an ilevel range in the future; at least, that's what I expect the grayed out \"Filters by Item Level\" stub is going to be for. This request is to help cover the common \"filter everything from heroic-difficulty raids out\" case in the meantime.) More granular normal vs heroic dungeon ranges might be useful to some people as well.",
