    "Description": "Using IE8 I load up my old character and make changes to it.  I then hit File->Save and choose a new folder and new name.  I hit Ok.  I go to that folder and there is no file created.\n \nI attempted this in Firefox but it's so slow and unwieldy I couldn't even GET to the save button.  After loading the char the whole thing basically stops working.\n \nI am using Silverlight 4 (checked on MS site that I am up to date).  Attached file I am using.",

Both of these fail to produce an output file. No error is reported.",
