      "Message": "Removed all versions of .net and reinstalled the latest version from Microsoft (v4).  Problem persists.  Also loaded same character from armory and had the same issues.  When I loaded from the armory I switched into dkdps module and was able to view the trinket list on the right hand pane.  I then began switching out the gear, from tank to dps, one piece at a time.  It wasn't until I switched out the trinket slot that the program crashed.\r\n\r\nJust downloaded a fresh copy of rawr onto my pc and have loaded the dpsdk module.  Everything appears to be working as intended.  Trinkets are accessible and viewable.  I'll post any other related issues here if I come across them.  Thanks again to the dev team for your time on this awesome project!\r\n\r\nNot sure if this link is related or even helpful but...http://runtingsproper.blogspot.com/2010/02/solved-error-1053-eventtype-clr20r3.html",
