    "Description": "Description: Rawr runs extremely slow, almost to the point that it seems to lock up. It takes two or three minutes to change an item. \n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Import a Rogue from game with addon, or from armory\n2) Load Rawr on EJ or stand-alone either one\n \nObservations:\n1) It takes a long time to populate\n2) Changing an item, gem, chant. Takes a serious long time.\n3) Will not Optimize, even after you are patient waiting on the above.\n \nAdditional Information: \nRawr 4.0.15 Beta\nWindows 7 and XP-3\n \nI am basing the speed off of the fact that I can manipulate items, gems, optimize, etc. On my Mage without any slowness. It is almost instant. Closer to the old WOLK Rawr. \n \nAttachments: \nHnT_4.0.xml",
