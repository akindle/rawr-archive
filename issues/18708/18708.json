    "Description": "Love the service, you guys rock. Thanks for all your hard work.\n \nI have only one issue with this fabulous tool: The paladin tank model doesn't allow me to use boss attack values higher than 100k. This is a little off from the lich king's 200k+ attack values. +100k to slider bar or maybe even a place to enter whatever number I please would really be a great thing.\n \nThanks again, I hope something this simple won't get overlooked.",
