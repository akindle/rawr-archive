    "Description": "On the mage template:\n1.improved frost warding doesnt seem to improve dps by gaining mana because there didnt seem to be a way to use fire/frost ward (even by modeling 100 fire dmg absorbed every second with 150 fire resist)\n2. no way to simulate hmyn of hope or revitalize yet\n3.the usage on the crit/haste trinket from faction champions doesnt seem to be averaged in the dps, i know its terrible btw\n \n on the Tank dk template  \n1.glyphing into improved unbreakable armor reduced my mitigation and survival for some reason...\n2.speccing into scent of blood also didnt improve threat\n3. the tank trink from onyxia's head doesnt factor in the health per second as any survival value\n4. the dodge/armor trinket from faction champs doesnt factor in the stacking armor usage as well\n5. no way to model revitalize for RP generation\n \nDps DK template\n1.same with tank dk no way to model reviatilize\n2.Call of the victor (exper/ap trink from faction champ) doesnt model the usage of ap stacks\n3.I also have a problem with simulating the usage of Howling Blast when Killing Machine and Freezing fog both proc, as that speccing into howling blast and putting something like .6 on the rotation, doesnt improve dps\n \n \nif there is any solution/fix to these issues it would be greatly appreciated, thanks",
