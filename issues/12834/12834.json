    "Description": "I´ve tried several builds for lock with b4 and found several issues\n \nTalents\nMoltencore is missing from the demonology tree.\nBacklash and Pyroclasm have changed position in 3.1, also backlash needs 2 points in intensity and pyroclasm has 3 talent points instead of 2.\nDemonic pact gives no dps increase even when no spellpower buffs are enabled, neither do Death´s embrace, Pandemic, or Improved Life tap, (Dps from Imp LT should be minimal but still not non- existant, specially in the longer fights)\n \nGlyphs\nGlyph of Corruption only gives a dps increase if Nightfall is enabled.\nGlyph of Felguard and glyph of Chaosbolt do not increase Dps.\n \nI can´t find any way to indicate the use of of Drain Soul instead of Shadow Bolt when under 25% or Soulfire when decimation procs. It´s probably not implemented yet.\n \nThere doesn´t seem to be a way to indicate wich should be the backdraft sequence.\n \nWhen trying out full afliction y noticed that unstable afliction and immolate conflict with eachother. When both apear in the casting sequence the last one isn´t taken into acount (adding their glyphs doesn´t add the dps they add when the other spell isn´t enabled and removing the second spell does not result in any change in Dps.)\n \nUnder options, in the pet tab, there is a posibility to use a doomguard the last minute in the fight, this should say use the Infernal.\n \nI´m aware that pets aren´t fully implemented yet, but for a more accurate calculation (specially for demonology builds) there should be a posibility to enable physical dps buffs and debuffs for them.\n \nDespite these issues the sheet looks great ^^, thank you for your hard work.",
