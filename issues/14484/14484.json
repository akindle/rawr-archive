    "Description": "The mage hit rating calculation for Rawr v2.2.23 is being done incorrectly. The hit rating and displayed value are correct (142 is 8.41% without heroic presence or misery/improved faerie fire), but the spec calculations are not correct. Fire, Arcane, and frost all have 100% chance to hit on the mouseover and appear to have 100% chance to hit in optimizer results. The program is choosing Boots of the mourning widow (ilevel 245) as a better upgrade than Footpads of the Icy Floe (ilevel 245) over my currently equipped Sandals of the Silver Magus (ilevel 232). In previous calculations, the optimizer forced me to maintain the hit cap and would choose Footpads of the Icy Floe or another item with hit rating on it. Deselecting and reselecting the hit buffs changes the percentage displayed properly (misery or improved faerie fire adds 3%, heroic presence 1% while keeping the same hit rating number), but the mouseover and calculation figure remain the same at 100%. Closing and restarting the program does not solve the issue either.",
