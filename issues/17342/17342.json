    "Description": "Only very minor issues, but it's now several releases since this bugs were introduced, and it shouldn't be hard to fix them.\nÂ \n1) The DPSDK and TankDK icons in the splash screen are larger than all other ones. The text at the right of the icons overlap them, and the TankDK icon also slightly overlaps the ProtWarr icon below it.\n2) The second minor issue in the splash screen, which has been present for even longer now, is that the Warlock icon and version text overlap the UI and Base version texts.",
