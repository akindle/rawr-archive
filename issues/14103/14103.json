    "Description": "I set the number of displayed gemming templates to only showing the top one.  This works well when looking at each slot, but not in the Direct upgrades tab.  There, if you have 6 templates, it will show the item 6 times which makes the list abnormally long and difficult to process easily.  Could we get it changed so it respects the \"show the top 'n' gemmings\" setting.  thanks.",

      "Message": "Just  a reminder that this is still an issue in the current versions.   I have only 4 upgrades for an instance but they show up as about 20 different things in the upgrade list due to some extra default gemmins I have set up (Nightmare Tears & ArPen gems).  Makes it much harder to read, especially when you have all the teir pieces with similar name as well as the same items with different iLvls.\r\n\r\nThanks",
