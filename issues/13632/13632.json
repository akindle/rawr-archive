    "Description": "I know warlock is still in development... was just curious with regards to the following: if i wanted to tell rawr to count crit with 100% damage on Corruption and Unstable Afflication, is this something I can edit in the interface or would it need to be modified in the code directly?  Presently when I scroll over the details for those 2 spells I see crit at 0, so I cant imagine there's no way for me to edit and change that, seeing all the great customization functionalities you guys implemented in Rawr :-)",

Note that Corruption and Unstable Affliction have no direct damage component, so you will see 0 hits and 0 crits for them. However, the average dot tick should correctly reflect the crit chance that your character has.",
