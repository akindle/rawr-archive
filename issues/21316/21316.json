    "Description": "I switched the Bosshandler to 85 so my Defense stats schould look the same as in the WoW arsenal.\n \nAllthough, on Rawr I get a Dodge Rating of 1612.191 (13.3314%) unbuffed\nAnd on the Armory and in game I only have 1492 dodge rating (12.78%)\nThis seems a bit odd.\n \nThe link to my toon is: http://eu.battle.net/wow/de/character/die-silberne-hand/Schroom/advanced",

      "Message": "yes setting my weapon enchant from Windwalk to none resolved the issue.\r\n\r\nalthough I don't think this is how it should work.  Windwalk is a proc with an up-time of about 30%.\r\nand gives 600 dodge rating, So I believe there is only an average shown in rawr.\r\n\r\nas a tank although I want to see the worst case scenario and check if I'm still block caped when this worst case scenario happens.\r\n\r\nan option to enable the proc would be a nice gimmick then, so I could compare, worst and best case.\r\n\r\nalthough showing an average of a procc, and putting it into the calculation  just doesn't seem right for me.",
