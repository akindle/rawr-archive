    "Description": "I already noticed that once in 2.3.3 but couldn't reproduce it back then, but now I can reproduce the following each time:\nÂ \n1. Open the attached XML (Ret Paladin).\n2. Switch to Trinket 1 view.\n3. Note: All DC: Greatness variants are shown correctly, (Str 377 DPS, Agi 305 DPS, Int 204 DPS, Spi 203 DPS.\n4. Switch to Trinket 2 view.\n5. Note: Str is not shown because it's equipped in Trinket 1, that's ok. But all other variants are incorrect, seems like they only show the stat DPS but not the proc DPS (Agi 100 DPS, Int 1 DPS, Spi 0 DPS).",

      "Message": "That's probably just a bug with double-greatness cards, and not with it depending on which slot you're looking at.  Try un-equipping the DMC:G card from Trinket 1, then look at both Trinket1 and Trinket2 slots.\r\n\r\nIs it even possible to get two greatness cards?",

      "Message": "You are right, if I unequip it, both slots show the correct values.\r\n\r\nAbout your question:\r\nI did a quick Google search and found this:\r\n\"I think I read somewhere on ej that someone asked a GM and got confirmation that the \"Equip:\" bonus stacks, but the two cards' proc effect will share the same internal hidden cooldown.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't know that before, and from that perspective it's even correct what Rawr shows me. A second card would only give me stats, no proc.\r\nIf that's really the case I'm sorry about the created issue, this can be closed then.",
