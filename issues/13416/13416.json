      "Message": "Actually there is, because Rawr does use less than 5 CP in the Rip & Ferocious Bite cycle, currently counting a 1CP Bite as 2/6 of a 5CP Bite which is pretty far from the truth.\r\nThe \"per energy\" part is completely unused right now but would be useful for additional work on the cat rotations.\r\n\r\nOf course that cycle isn't very realistic, but that is a seperate issue I'd like to work on at some point in the future (which is why I am poking around in the code).",

      "Message": "If you want to keep the current code, estimating it at 1/5 of a Bite per CP should be pretty close to the truth for decent gear (which will also result in close to 5 CP for the Bites in the mixed cycle, keeping the error very small).",
