I have tested on two different machines, online and offline versions, and caches cleared, several days apart.\n \nCould you confirm whether you've retested this since 18698 was closed and 19169 was raised? It may be that 18698 needs re-opening or that the EA guy has killed off Rawr's access (apologies for teaching you to suck eggs here).\n \nThe error is as per the other threads:\nAn exception occurred during the operation, making the result invalid.

I fully understand your frustration Jothay with users complaining about the error in Rawr 2/Rawr 3 however this is the very latest Rawr4 I'm getting a similar error on.
