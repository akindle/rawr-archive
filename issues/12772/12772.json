    "Description": "I've found a 100% repeatable method. Do a load from armory and enter garbage in both name & realm field so armory load will fail. It gets to line 606 of FormMain with a null character object.\n \nStepping out it looks like bw_ArmoryGetCharacterComplete() e.Error is not null and so its trying to do a LoadCharacterIntoForm() with a null value for character.\n \nLooks like the line at FormMain.cs 716 should perhaps have another check for e.Result != null in there somewhere.\n \nI tried release v2.2.0b3 and this bug exists there too so its not something recently committed.\n \nHope this helps.\n \n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character, Boolean unsavedChanges) in C:\\temp\\Rawr\\FormMain.cs:line 606\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character) in C:\\temp\\Rawr\\FormMain.cs:line 601\n   at Rawr.FormMain.bw_ArmoryGetCharacterComplete(Object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e) in C:\\temp\\Rawr\\FormMain.cs:line 724\n   at System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.OnRunWorkerCompleted(RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\n   at System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.AsyncOperationCompleted(Object arg)",
