    "Description": "Not sure it would qualify as an issue.. But, never the less..\nSorted after DPS, loaded my char from Armory. (Mage)\n \nEncircling Burnished Gold Chains = 106,53\nChain of Latent Energies = 99,03\n \nI feel Chain of Latent Energies should be rated higher as it has the same SP, 9 more hit AND 36 Haste instead of 34 Spirit (which as a mage is not exactly a stat i try to stack)\n \nIn my book the Chain of Latent Energies blows the Burnished Gold Chains out of the water, but maybe I missed something crucial.. A setting of some sort, or just a general brain malfunction on my part..",
