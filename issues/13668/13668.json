    "Description": "Forgive me if the answer to this is somewhere else and I have overlooked it. I tried searching for it on the site but couldn't seem to find anyone else having this issue.\n \nMy buttons in Rawr have disappeared. It seems that they are just off the screen somewhere but I can't figure out how to make them come back.\n \nI have been having this issue since BC builds (no new build has fixed my issue) and have always dealt with it by memorizing where the buttons are, but I figure it must be a problem that could be solvable.\n \nI guess it is easier to just show screen shots of the problem than to explain anything else. Any help would be appreciated.\n \nScreenshots:\nItem updater maximized - http://www.twitpic.com/au3q9\nItem updater minimized - http://www.twitpic.com/au3rz\nWelcome Screen - http://www.twitpic.com/au3tn",

Please at least evaluate the effort necessary to support non-default settings, and if it must be, clearly state that Rawr won't support it.",

There's no plans for Rawr2 to mess with WinForms' incredibly broken \"DPI\" functionality (which totally isn't.) Rawr3 will not use WinForms, so you won't have an issue.",
