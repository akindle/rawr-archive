    "Description": "I am using the latest source from SVN and for armor I generally agree with the rogue model.\n \nHowever using the optimizer I get some very strange results. The Onyxia weapons are not just a little bit better, but has an upgrade score of more than twice than the second best (ICC Weapons). I have looked and looked at the weapons and can't imagine how it can be.\n \nI will attach my character and the upgrade list to this message. (Obviously my rogue got pretty crap gear, but still the upgrades look suspicious to me)",
