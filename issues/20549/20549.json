    "Description": "The import functionality from battle.net fails to import the active glyphs of my spec. Somehow it thinks I have active Berserk, Lacerate, Mangle, Rip, Shred, Tiger's Fury (6 primes) and Feral Charge, Frenzied Regeneration, Maul, Rebirth, Thorns, Aquatic Form (this is minor glyph btw), Challenging Roar (this is also minor btw), Dash (again should be minor), Unburdened Rebirth (minor) (so total 9 active major glyphs according to rawr, from which like 1/3 is actually minor glyphs, but placed in among majors?)",

    {
      "Message": "I don't believe the battle.net import loads glyphs yet (or have you implemented that, Jothay?). Models set their own default glyphs instead, and you're seeing so many set because you're loading it as a Bear, and then switching to Cat, I think? Regardless, the glyphs being categorized wrong is valid anyway, and we should still get the glyph importing working.",

      "Message": "The glyphs were set up wrong for several classes (a degredation over time) which is part of why this wasn't working right. A recent audit I performed brought all of them up 4.1.0 values and are all verified as up to date. I'm going to mark this fixed and close it when the next version releases. If it is still an issue then, please reopen.",
