    "Description": "It was my understanding that Runeforge enchants are only available to Deathknights and that you cannot \"Enchant\" another person's weapon with a Rune using Runeforge (even if they are in Shadow Vault where there is a Rune Furnace). However the Weapon enchant of Rune of Stoneskin Gargoyle is showing up in the Bear Module.\nÂ \nA good way to test this in RAWR is to set the Survival setting way too high (say 300,000) and the program will say the best enchanting is Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle.",
