    "Description": "I went to load my hunter from battle.net and from a file I had saved.  Doing both options give me the following error:\n \n== Version: 4.2.4.0 ==\n== StackTrace ==\n   at Rawr.Hunter.StatsHunter.Accumulate(StatsHunter data, Single weight)\n   at Rawr.Hunter.CalculationsHunter.GetSpecialEffectsStats(Character Char, Dictionary`2 triggerIntervals, Dictionary`2 triggerChances, StatsHunter statsTotal, StatsHunter statsToProcess)\n \nThere is no suggested fix listed.\n \nI know the hunter model isn't perfect, but I just wanted to primarily load my hunter, change a few items so I could resim it's values with another program that is up to date.",
