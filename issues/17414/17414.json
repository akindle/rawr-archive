    "Description": "With Character Profiler enabled in WoW, I opened my bank box to get info on available items, and I also opened my Enchanting window to get info on available enchants. I then exited WoW and loaded my Character Profiler information in Rawr v2.3.15. \n \nThe gear in the bank is now marked as available, but all the Enchanting info is missing. This isn't that big of a deal for most enchants because I can easily go through and mark them as available, but the entire Finger enchant list is empty!\n \n(I saved this character, then loaded it in Rawr3 Beta and I could see the finger enchants there. I saved there and reloaded in v2.3.15 and still can't see them.)",
