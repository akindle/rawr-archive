    "Description": "This problem still persists -- I noticed that this bug was reported back in May. Optimizer still insists on placing enchants on offhands items though. This is problematic because, for instance, Optimizer is recommending I enchant my offhand with 25 crit/25 hit. Well, when I remove the enchant, that means I need to make up 25 hit elsewhere.\nÂ \nIn theory, Rawr shouldn't allow enchants to go on any non-weapon off-hand items or wands (which was also a problem at one point).",
