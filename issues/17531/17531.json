That included ignite damage by design, but I realize for testing purposes it might not be the best thing. Do you have any suggestions on how to present the data?",

      "Message": "The spell details are fine, I know they contain Ignite damage for criticals. I'm talking about the \"By spell\" breakdown, if you look at the average fireball crit which to my knowledge doesn't include ignite since ignite is already represented you'll see the critical damage is higher then it is supposed to be. In my example 5193.49 is the average critical for fireball shown under \"By spell\" that however doesn't fit because 6881.18 is maximum damage including ignite so a maximum that doesn't include ignite is 4915.12 (6881.18/1.4) and that can't be smaller then the average critical shown in \"By spell\".\r\n\r\nI hope I make some sense.",

      "Message": "There was a bug in how the damage ranges were displayed when hit rate was <100%. It inappropriately discounted for hit rate when that was already taken into account, so the shown damage ranges were too high.\r\n\r\nWhat you're seeing however is something else. If you check the solution you'll see the following:\r\n\r\nSpell Cycles: \r\nIdle Regen: 169.34 sec\r\nEvocation: 1.00x (721.75 mps)\r\nFFBLBPyro: 91.68 sec (1093.05 dps, 144.96 mps, 1018.64 tps)\r\nCombustion+FBLBPyro: 31.31 sec (2157.20 dps, 185.52 mps, 1941.48 tps)\r\n\r\nSo the only time Fireball is used is with combustion. But during combustion you gain 50% critical strike damage bonus, which is why the crits are higher than what you're expecting.",

I compute what would be the average uptime for the whole fight assuming the same cycle and cooldowns would be up for the whole fight and use that average uptime for that cycle/cooldown combination. It is a good approximation, but it is not exactly the same as computing average uptime for the final cycle/cooldown solution. The graph currently shows the latter. If you'd like the first one I'd have to display it for each cycle, but probably just for no cooldowns situation. Or I can show the average in the legend of the graph.",
