      "Message": "Since he didn't create the issue for it, I went ahead and did it.  This is due to my removal of irrelevant stats from Moonkin.  Stamina isn't technically relevant, and run speed isn't modeled, which made the enchant disappear from the list.  This is probably the case for most of the other disappearing enchants.",

My guess it's probably things like hit to gloves, which disappeared likely due to attempting to filter out stupid generic items like the Librarian's Papercutter.",

It only works of stuff you know, and doesn't remove something because there's stats on there that you aren't modelling, it's a more robust approach in the long run as it won't automatically remove new items that have new (unmodelled) stats.\r\n\r\nJust checked my calendar for today, and I may have the free spot to work on that post I've been planning to do for so long now >.<\r\n",

Please give us a little flexibility for enchanting to suit our GM's requirements, or to fill in insufficiencies for our gear.  For example, my raiding guild asks almost all classes to put Tuskarr's Vitality on their boots. It is very useful when dashing out of the way of ICC AoE's... and so currently I am not selecting any enchant for boots, since you don't have the one I am required to use.\r\nResto Druid....\r\n",
