    "Description": "When comparing my in-game stats I noticed there was a difference and eventually found that the base (ungeared) stats are the wrong value and too low for level 90. Some examples is my in-game base stamina is 67 but the rawr base stamina is 63. My in-game base intellect is 226 and the rawr base intellect is 207.\n\nThis isn't that important but it would be good to fix since it throws out the values derived from base stats e.g. attack power, spellpower, crit ect.",
