    "Description": "Meta Gem Socketing Not Considering Dependant Gem Options:\n(Running on a Mage, but assuming that it would be the same issue for all)\n(i've started using RawR since v2.2.2, and just went back to using it again, since today's so called UpDate v2.2.3 is horribly broken in respect to gemming.)\nWhen i run the optimizer, it creates my head piece with the optimized to use:\n[Chaotic Skyflare Diamond], however the requirements for that meta gem are 2 blue gems, the optimizer Completely ignores that fact, and still tells me to use it, and does not make any of my gems blue, purple, or green in any of my other sockets in my suit.  in fact it tells me to gem runed scarlet rubies in my blue sockets, foregoing my socket bonuses! LOL\nI understand that the +19 SP are supposed to be better even with the negation of the socket bonus, however, the it's rather stupid to tell me to use a meta-gem that will become useless, due to the requirements for it's activation not being met.\n \nIn conclusion, i end up using [Beaming Earthsiege Diamond], for simplicity sake...\n \nBut my point is the rating of many head pieces is drastically changed by using the 2 different meta-gems, making certain other pieces in my inventory better that when i end up using the 2nd gem.\n \nErgo, it's a horrible inconsitency that hopefully get addressed ASAP!\n \nthx, otherwise for a great program.",
