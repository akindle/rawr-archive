    "Description": "I am a Mage that uses Rawr often to see about upgrades and reforging items. I am having an issue where my stats do not load properly.  By stats I mean my spell power, haste, hit, etc.  It seems to be doing this because it is not loading my equipment right with some of its current modifications and it is telling me to make, in some cases, changes to gear that in most instances the item has already been modified and it is loading improperly.  Seems to be flip flopping too which gear is better than others.  I am presuming there are more issues with the embedded version in elitist jerks than the downloadable one made on May 9th which I have tried and also does the same thing?  Ideas?",
