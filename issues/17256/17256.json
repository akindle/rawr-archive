    "Description": "The rarity level of gems on the Gemming Templates  does not seem to be saving, either on a per-character or global basis.\n \nI have several 80s, of which two are in epic gems, one in rares, and a brand new one in uncommons.  When I uncheck the default epic template set, and check one of the other two options, and then save the character, when I return to it, the templates have reverted to only having epic gems checked.  If I don't change it to uncommon every time I start up, and I don't have specific gemmings locked in per item, it tries to gem my brand new 80 with epics when I optimize.\n \nI have a total of 7 .xml files across 5 80s, and it seems to be behaving the same for all of them.",
