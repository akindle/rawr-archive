    "Description": "I use the Rawr optimizer about once a week and don't believe there's been a problem before today. Today I forced reload my informatoin off battle.net to make sure it is current with new item on my back. When I run optimizer it says I'm missing enchants. When I look closer I see that none of my enchants are showing up. Why is that not loading from battle.net?  I've tried reloading and forcing the update several times with no success. Battle.net's wowarmory shows my enchants.  What do I need to do to resolve this?",
