    "Description": "The Armor Penetration hard cap is 1260 for a DK with the Blood Gorged talent (10% ArP).\nThe Rawr.DPSDK model doesn't take this into account, causing ArP to have value when at the cap (value should be 0 when at 1260).\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Load attached character \"crantor-dps.xml\"\n2. Verify on the Stats tab that the character has 1259 Armor Penetration\n3. In the Comparisons pane, selected \"Slot: Gems >> Red\"\n4. Expected: Fractured Dragon's Eye and Fractured Cardinal Ruby should both be rated at a very small dps upgrade (the actual cap w/ Blood Gorged is ~1259.615, so my character is ~.62 off the hard cap)\nActual: Fractured Dragon's Eye is still by far the largest DPS upgrade gem\nFurther: Frac. DE and Frac. CR gems should have the same marginal dps upgrade (since only .62 of their available 34/20 ArP rating will be utilized)\nActual: Frac. DE is a much larger DPS upgrade over Frac. CR, indicating the hard cap is not calculated at ~1259.62\n \nAdditional Information:\nRawr v. 2.3.12\nOS: Windows Vista 64-bit Premium\n \nI will look into the model's code and determine if this check was omitted or if this is buggy behavior. I will update this ticket with anything I find.",
