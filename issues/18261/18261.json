    "Description": "I've noticed that the DPSWarr module Optimizer from a couple of versions back to now has degraded in speed drastically. It now take more than 2 hours (in a full thorough optimizer setting) to optimize my gear, even though I don't have that much gear, but worst, and what is killing me, is trying to build an upgrade list, which I had to stop after 1 day and half, when it still was at 50% more or less. Comparing that with the ProtWarr module, where it takes around 2-5 minutes to optimize my gear (which I have a lot) in a full thorough optimizer setting, and around 2 hours to build the upgrade list ... the difference is humongous. \nÂ \nHave you seen this issue happening?",
