      "Message": "This is a threading issue in moonkin at CalculationsMoonkin.cs line 172. It tries to access a WPF controls data context. This can be called from worker threads in the context of optimizer which creates a invalid cross thread access (The calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it.). Suggested fix would be to store the reference character or calculation options in the CalculationsMoonkin.",
