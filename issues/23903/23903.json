    "Description": "I imported my character Jocund from Norgannon and saved it to an existing character file.  I now get an error (pasted below) when I try to open it.  I tried several more times, creating new saved character files with the same result.  My characer files that have not been saved from a recent import still work fine.\n\n   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException(ExceptionArgument argument ExceptionResource resource)\n   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException()\n   at System.Collections.Generic.List`1.set_Item(Int32 index, T value)\n   at Rawr.ItemSet.GenerateItemSetFromSavedString(String source)\n   at Rawr.Character.b__30(String itemset)\n   at Rawr.ListUtils.<>c__DisplayClass4`2.b__3(TInput item)\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.WhereSelectListIterator`2.MoveNext()\n   at System.Collections.Generic.List`1..ctor(IEnumerable`1 collection)\n   at Rawr.ListUtils.ConvertAll[TInput,TOutput](IEnumerable`1 source, Converter`2 converter)\n   at Rawr.Character.LoadFromXml(String xml)\n\nFor the last few weeks I have not been able to import from Battle.net - kept getting a security error.  I have used rawr since it first came out and this is the first time I've ever had any seriouse problem.",

These updates don't change the number and it is not clear what they are doing - or at least not clear to me ;>)\n ",
