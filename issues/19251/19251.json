    "Description": "As can be seen in the image attached, in Rawr.Mage the items are not showing correctly at all. No DPS bar is visible and items are sorted by their survivability value.\nI have thrown random items into the slots just in case it was bugging out, it didn't help. I havn't touched any of the configuration settings at all, I just loaded the Mage model and refreshed all items (twice, to be safe). This is occurring with both the online version on EJ and the downloaded one via the \"Install Offline\" button.\nIf there is any other information I can provide, please let me know, I'm not brilliant with computers though. Thanks :-)",
