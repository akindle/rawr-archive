    "Description": "Don't know if this has been reported before, but sometimes, between versions (not always), I get a XML Parsing error when trying to load a saved character from the previous version of Rawr, so I end up erasing all my XML files and starting all over from character import.  As I say, it does not happen with every Rawr upgrade, but it does happen frequently.  Are you aware of this?  Any ideas and how to avoid this errors?  It really is a pain to start all over again when this happens.",
