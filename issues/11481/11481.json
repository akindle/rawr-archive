Same thing goes for Improved Faerie Fire with Faerie Fire, which is why in the latest code, I have added code to show Faerie Fire on the buffs list.  I didn't tie Improved Moonkin Form spell power bonus to Improved Moonkin Form buff because, well, if you have the Moonkin Form buff and you have Improved Moonkin Form talent it's assumed that it's your own Moonkin Form.",
