    "Description": "when i close rawr 2.3.4 i get an error message that has 3 buttons \"details\" \"continue\" and \"close\" the message reads \"close will shut down rawr\" so i hit close and nothing happens. i go to exit rawr again and same error. then on the third try it closes but encounters an error. it says to copy it and send it in an email but i cant select any of the text or \"ctrl - c\" which it says to do. iv encountered no problems yet as to the actual running of rawr, but this is something very odd. i run windows 7 if that matters here since it mattered for some other programs i have as well.",
