      "Message": "As of right now, no. What I would suggest as a temporary fix is to edit the item. Probably the easiest and less likely for you to crash otherwise is to first select a different helm, and deselect the helm as an available item. Right click the helm in question and select \"edit item\" In the bottom left corner select delete item. Then under the Options menu select edit items. In the bottom left corner select the add button and type in \"71011.\" Search for Flickering Cowl, and edit the 378 version. Then type in the stats you want. The reason I am having you go this route is due to the Random enchants, if you edit the random enchants while you have the item selected or selected as available, the system starts acting up.\r\n\r\nNow you could however select another helm, deselect the helm in question, edit it and remove all random enchants (just search for all of the check boxes and de-select any you see), and edit the item with the stats you currently have if you find that easier to do.",
