      "Message": "Look at the chart showing time spent on each spell, and you'll see that Rawr doesn't think you are casting regrowth, so the glyph doesn't help.  Under individual spell comparisons, you will see the glyph making a difference.\r\n\r\nTo force Rg in your overall rotation, go to Options/Stats/Single Target Maximum Healng Mix, and pick a rotation that has Rg* (note the asterisk).  I think those rotations use Rg as the preferred direct heal.\r\n\r\nIt isn't clear to me that you can select a rotation that uses Nourish as your direct heal, but still clips Rg, to take advantage of Glyph of Regrowth.  I also don't see how Rawr lets you use Rg (clipped for the glyph) for raid healing.\r\n",
