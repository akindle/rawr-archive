    "Description": "I am using all the time Rawr.Enhance's feature to export to EnhSim. There is however a minor nuisance with this:\n \nOn my system, regional settings are such that the decimal point character is a comma (this is set from Control Panel - Regional and Language Settings). Fractional numbers should be written as \"1,2\" and not \"1.2\". However the EnhSim export uses both formats. Here's how the export data begins:\n \n \n##########################################\n### Rawr.Enhance Data Export to EnhSim ###\n##########################################\n \nconfig_source rawr\n \nrace                            draenei\nmh_speed                        2,6\noh_speed                        2,6\nmh_dps                          171.3\noh_dps                          143.5\n \n(note the comma used for mh_speed and oh_speed and the dot used for mh_dps and oh_dps).\n \nAs a workaround, after I import the data into EnhSim, I simply change manually the 2 commas to dots, as EnhSim ignores the system setting and only recognizes decimal dots. But the first time I used it there was a huge difference in simmed results that took quite a while to debug (the difference between comma and dot is quite hard to see).\n \nI suggest Rawr should use the dot also for the  mh_speed and oh_speed values.",
