    "Description": "I know you have the beta now, that's nice, but it pops up every single time i open rawr to remind me.  I just upgraded hoping 2.3.14 would stop this, but alas....\nÂ \nI'm running rawr under mono (on linux) if that's the problem, maybe you did intend to have it show only once and it's just buggy under this alternate environment.  (also, fwiw, not too happy v3 is in silverlight)",

      "Message": "ah ok, suppose that's decent then.  Might I table the proposition of having no popups?  Popups are very annoying.  \r\n\r\nWhile we're on the subject, the \"welcome\" popup is more of a hindrance than a help as well (also due to mono problems, but i could say the same when i use it normally on windows)  Why can't rawr just start, without a splash screen and without any popup notification or \"intro\" window?",
