    "Description": "I just downloaded the 2.3.11 version after having used previous versions successfully.\n \nI downloaded my character from the armory, fixed the pet, talents, shot priority/rotation (am a hunter) and the dps shows significantly off (like 4k off) \n \nI then went and did an open on a previous saved xml file that I've used in the past for offline tinkering, changed it to my correct gear, and the dps appeared appropriate.\n \nJust to double check, I went and manually selected the components to avoid the download, and it's still obtaining the screwy (~1600 dps) values instead of the correct values.\n \nAny thoughts?",

The suggested regemming was suppose to double my current haste but none of the gems were haste gems. I tried it out just to be sure - and sure enough no difference in my haste rating.
