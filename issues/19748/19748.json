    "Description": "For my feral cat, the strength trinkets are ranked way too high. I think this is due to a faulty ICD/duration ratio in the code or whatever, because the tooltips look like they don't follow the duration x 5 = ICD - rule(for procc trinkets).\nÂ \nReported this as bug for the in-game addon first, because I hadn't found this page, and the mod/creator pointed me here.",

      "Message": "Well, I went through all of the trinkets, and I can vouch that almost every single trinket is correctly marked in terms of the 5 * duration for On Equip and 6 * duration for On Use.\r\n\r\nThere are a few that are not following these rules, most of whom are tanking trinkets. The only other that is not following this rule is Grace of the Herald. The Rogue Community on EJ found out that the ICD on this is 100 seconds instead of the expected 50 seconds.\r\n\r\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f78/t105429-cataclysm_mechanics_testing/\r\n\r\nSo unless you can provide your character name/realm or post your saved file, so that we can see what you are seeing, I don't know what else to tell you.",

Heart of Rage heroic is on top, and it says 20 sec duration / 45 sec ICD, and that looks very wrong. Heart of Solace heroic is the next other trinket, with the same duration/ICD ratio.",
