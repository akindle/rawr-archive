    "Description": "I like to copy the gear out to a text file to read it easier and record various sets for comparison. I can easily delete extra information I do not care about (for this purpose), but I have to manually type in each gem and enchant on each item.\n \nSuggestion: Include Gems (and their color) and Enchants along with the items on the infomation copied out to the clipboard.\nSuggested format:\nHead\t\tNoth's Curse(my)\t\tChaotic Skyflare Diamond(m), Potent Monarch Topaz(o), Arcanum of Blissful Mending\n \nThank you for a great program.",
