    "Description": "YES, I know the Lock dev hasn't really even started in on the model yet.\nYES I know that means it's effectively broken and should not be used for gear decisions.\n \nFrom this thread: (http://rawr.codeplex.com/discussions/232935?ProjectName=rawr)\n\"What can you do in the meantime? If you're not a coder or a modeler, test out the model in its current limited state and open issues if you find anything that isn't already reported (following the posting guidelines, of course). If you have the time and the skills to send more detailed feedback, that's welcome too.\" -Erstyx himself\n\"You and others could do this for the warlock model. Use the accurate sim to find the issues in the model and post specific results (in the issues section not the discussions please) so that the developer doesn't have to waste his time finding these flaws he can concentrate on applying the fixes.\" -Levva\n \nWith that aim, I ran a numbers pass comparing Rawr's results with SimCraft's results.\nI got them as similar as possible by removing from SC the enchants that aren't implemented in the model yet, and leaving all buffs off for both. I limited the SC action list to what's implemented in the Rawr priority list, and I ran them both without execute phase - Using an execute phase seems to make rawr's numbers go *down*, and I figure it's simpler to get normal phase working first.\nThe profile I used is Lucifeltest.xml.\n \n[Edit: Numbers pass removed, because it was an ugly wall of text and also outdated. Pass for latest version coming soon.]\n \nNOTE - If you want to share your own comparisons too, great, but please do so in file attachments rather than huge comments, so it's clean and readable here.",

There's a difference still in Spell Damage, but I pinned down the cause.\r\nSpell Power is saying 6064 before procs, when it's 6702 in game. Rawr isn't counting Fel Armor's bonus of 638.\r\nI thought at first there might have been a difference in mastery, but realized it was because of a proc effect I'd forgotten. Would you mind throwing a 'before procs' number in the info for that one, like the other stats have?\r\n\r\nIndividual spell comparisons coming soon. In an attachment, this time.\r\n ",

No buffs or debuffs present, no flasks, foods, potions, etc. With some notes.\r\nComparison 2: \"numberspass no execute 4-1-04\". On a hunch I skimmed the profile down further to eliminate execute phase as a factor. No alternate filler, no Death's Embrace damage boost.\r\nComparison 3: \"numberspass no procs 4-1-04\". On another hunch I trimmed it even farther, removing everything at all proccy except for the Haunted debuff from Haunt, and Eradication. I wanted to see if the differences in spell damage values were due to your model handling spellpower or plus-damage proc uptimes differently than theirs.\r\nRawr profile used: \"Lucifel 4104.xml\"",

I mentioned in the notes on one of my test runs that crit percentages were consistently much higher on rawr than SC. I did some checking in to it with the SC people, and it was partially a problem on their side (sim not properly applying Shadow and Flame off my shadowbolts), but part of it is in your model. Apparently (and this was news to me), boss-level mobs have an incoming spell crit reduction of 1.8%. So for instance a base crit chance of 25% on the character pane will crit 23.2% of the time. Patch notes mention it being in Rawr.Base as of 4.0.16.",

You can see this in-game -- even with ~15% haste, you'll see 4 ticks exactly 15 sec apart, not ~13 sec as would be expected.\r\n\r\nI know there are issues with Corruption's predicted damage, as well; something about how the mastery bonus interacts with the improved corruption talent. DrDamage gets it right, so I'm taking a look to see how it's doing the calculation.",

      "Message": "Thanks for the tip on BoD. That's useful information to have.\r\n\r\nAs of .60775 debug build:\r\n\r\n*Fel Armor bonus to spell damage isn't included.\r\n\r\n*Something's off with mana usage. Rawr says I can go 500 seconds without a single Life Tap, but Simcraft estimates I'd need 17 in that time range.\r\n\r\n*Haste is still significantly undervalued, but I have an idea on that. Looking at things like the average time between casts on Unstable Affliction, it looks like the model is re-casting DoTs just *after* they fall off; which was the correct way in Wrath, when casting it early could clip the last tick off your DoT. But since they changed all periodic effects to 'refresh' like Corruption, rather than 'overwrite', that's not the way you want to do them anymore. When Haste shortens the time between ticks, it builds up fractions of ticks at the end of the DoT's duration. When you refresh them properly, those fractions are carried over and accumulate, resulting in extra ticks down the line. But if you let the DoT fall off, like the old behavior, those fractions of ticks are just lost.",
