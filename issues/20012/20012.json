      "Message": "Your statement Schadow was incorrect.  You said 'Best in slot for resto shaman?'   \r\nYour chosen spell style is raid, using chain heal and rip tide.  For this specific setup and situation, yes, the proc just ends up winning over a 359 weapon.  However, change your style to anything else and you'll see trauma go poof.  \r\n\r\nThere are always items from previous expansions that end up still being useful, or better at the new level cap.  It's not a bug that trauma is up there, the proc is indeed that powerful, however it's only useful in a raid healing situation, so keep that in mind if you intend to use it.  If you don't want it there, filter out 277 items.",
