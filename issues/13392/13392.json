    "Description": "First of all this doesn't always happens so I'm guessing it might be a race condition...\n \nSetup: I run Rawr (v.2.2.5) on my laptop with Intel Core 2 Duo (T8100) on Windows Vista.\n \nAt some point when the Optimizer is calculating while \"Building Upgrade List\" the progress bars stops moving (the flash shinny effect still runs on the bars though) and the calculations never get further.\nI noticed that Windows Task Manager reports a CPU usage of 80-100% while the Optimizer runs with out problems but then it gets stuck/hangs it shows 49-50%.\n \nAgain I must specify that hang point is never the same place and it is not every time it gets stuck.\n \nWhen it gets stuck I have tried clicking the \"Cancel\" button and ALT-F4 but it seems that the only way to shutdown the program is to kill the process (for instance using the Task Manager).",
