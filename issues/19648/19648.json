One observation to note is that it does not appear to be related to loading a character from file or battle.net.  Error is also generated with the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Go to the rawr paget at http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php and click ok on the welcome window.\r\n2. Click option for \"Expand to Edit Basic Information\"\r\n3. Change Class/Model from the default Druid>Bear to Death Knight>DPSDK.\r\nResult is program crashes while apparently loading the modules associated with Death Knight>DPSDK.  I also tried all the other classes and models in this manner.  Only DPSDK crashes.  I hope this observation helps.",
