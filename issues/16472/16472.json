    "Description": "I just checked my previously made set on Rawr 2.3.9 into 2.3.10\n \nI noticed that TankPoint value for these items has greatly increased. I understand there has been some changes then. Can someone explain me if they are more correct now or false?\n \nAlso is there a way to edit ''Corroded Skeleton Key'' properly? I would like to see how useful Rawr thinks that 6400 absorb is. Atm I have edited it to ''-50% dmgtaken (dmgtaken/2min)'' as ICC harder bosses hit for like 12k than I can absorb 1/2 of the hit every 2mins.\n \np.s. I wanted to make this under discussions as I dunno if this is an Issue but I can't upload my .xml there :/",

Perhaps you had an outdated item cache?\r\n\r\nAbsorbed damage is not modeled in Rawr yet.  As Jothay pointed out, there is a patch to add it, but the implementation still needs to be refined.",
