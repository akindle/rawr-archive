      "Message": "When I open your file and immediately optimize I do not get that problem.  Instead it simply replaces 2 of your SP/Spi gems with straight SP gems.  Are there some extra step I need to take to replicate it?\r\n\r\nBy the way, do you mean to optimize your personal dps and ignore your pet's?  Optimize for \"Overall\" instead of \"DPS Rating\" to include your pet's dps in optimization.\r\n\r\n",

[would be nice if Rawr could print a summary of the stat changes - perhaps in the future :P]",
