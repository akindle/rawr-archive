    "Description": "When I inspect my gear with Rawr, it advicec to reforge all of my gear to Expertise, but I have an expertise cap with the Seal of Truth and the Glyph of Truth. \nHowever, I can't choose Seal of Truth in the Options - Fight Parameters. Glyph of Truth is not available too at the Talents - Glyph. \nIt would be great for retribution to have an opportunity to point that there is an expertise cap already. \nÂ \nThanks.",
