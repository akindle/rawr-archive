    "Description": "Has anyone else seen this?  I have multiple toons across several classes but when I try to load up my Paladin the T10 Lightsworn gear is not in the list.  I go into the item editor and they are all there yet I can't select them to plan my next gear upgrade.  I had this problem in 2.3.17 so I upgraded to 2.3.18 and have the same exact problem.  T10 is not exactly new, is it unreasonable to expect that the gear would be selectable?  I have switched between Holy, Prot and Ret and it's the same across the set.  This is with the base install of 2.3.18 with nothing changed.  As soon as 2.3.18 loaded I immediately changed the class to Belf, Paladin, Prot Paladin and tried to select the T10 shoulders or chest.",

      "Message": "Jothay I find your one word answer and closing of this issue rather rude.  You obviously knew that the problem was in Special Currency -> Emblem of Frost (all regular Tier 10 gear) -> Class Token (All Sanctified Tier 10) yet you choose to offer up that wonderful one word answer.  This is obviously something that has been asked before.  My first search through the Issue Tracker I did not select closed issues in my search criteria.  Once selecting it I found this information no thanks to your reply.  Why this item would not be checked in the base install is beyond me.  Why you would write a one word answer when clearly a few sentences could resolve this completely is also beyond me.  ",

If you don't wish to help the RAWR community as a good moderator should and just want to make snide one word comments and close topics then perhaps you should just keep quiet?  I work in the service industry and get asked questions over and over as well, yet I have not got snide and closed a topic with a one word answer.  Perhaps if there were so many complaints it would prompt the dev's to change the setting.  And yes, my first search turned up nothing because I did not include closed issues, and my second turned up answers as I stated in my post at 9:18am.  You here to help people with RAWR, not make people want to stop using RAWR for lack of support or fear that asking a questions would lead to what you did today.  How about you grow up a bit and join the grown up's and be a good moderator?  Thank you.",
