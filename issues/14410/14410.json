    "Description": "After creating a new character, selecting talents (including titan's grip), and then running the optimizer, the off hand becomes unselectable either in the right-hand paper doll or on the left-hand item list.  Before the optimizer is run, the off hand can be selected, but only shows green \"mitigation\" scale, not dps scale.  This happens in 2.2.20 and previous versions (earliest tested was 2.2.17 if I recall correctly).\nÂ \nThe second issue is on the stats screen, execute has 0 uses.  Toggling the <20% execute spamming checkbox in Options->Ability Maintenance has no effect, neither does selecting the execute glyph (which shows as 0 dps in the left-hand pane with slot->glyphs selected).  Only fury was tested.",
