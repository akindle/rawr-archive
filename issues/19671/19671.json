    "Description": "http://theincbear.com/vengeance-cap-theorycraft/\n \nBlues have replied about veng calcs being a little misleading and the true calc is now known. Source above has the formula. Not sure if the 4 tanking module owners are aware.\n \nBasically: vengeance = stamina + 0.1 * base health \n \nThe fact that stamina was buffed to 14 hp per stam late in beta did not change the original vengeance calc (10 per). This was intended. Talents and buffs and the like do not add to vengeance.",
