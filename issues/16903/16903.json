    "Description": "I have been using this now for about a month and one feature I think would be helpful is something that'll tell me what and how many mats are needed to creating an item in case that is what I want an upgrade to be. Example, if I chose to upgrade my chest to Breastplate of the White Knight along with other crafted items, I can open a tool that will create an excel spreadsheet that would tell me I need to grind/purchase/loot the following materials such as titansteel bars, crusader orbs, etc in order to complete my set. If this function already exists, please, someone point me to the right direction!!! I understand something like this does take time and coding to complete, however, it was something I was brainstorming and felt others would enjoy.",
