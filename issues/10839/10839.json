    "Description": "Rawr.Retribution seems to be valuing something in a funny way.\n \nI'm currently wearing Skullshatter Warboots (29 crit, 37 stam, 30 str, socked with +8str and +6stam/10ap, which gets me an additional 2crit TOTAL[ 31crit, 43stam, 38str, 10ap ] ).  Rawr is valuing them as 39.35dps.\n \nI just picked up some dreadboots of the leigon ( 30crit, 18hit, 40stam, 38str, socketed 2x5str/5crit, which gets me 3 extra str TOTAL[ 40crit, 40stam, 51str, 18hit ]).  Rawr values this at 32.80.\nIf i resocket it just like the skullshatter boots (which loses me the setbonus of course) rawr values them at 45.72.\n \nNote that I'm not even hit capped!  Which means even if all the stats were the same aside the hit, the dreadboots would still be better.",
