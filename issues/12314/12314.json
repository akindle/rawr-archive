    "Description": "Bad things seems to start happening with you update equipped items from WoWHead and/or the Armory.\nIn most cases, while the item icon is shown, no item is shown as equipped on the right side graph.\nThis implies to me that there may be dangling pointers to deallocated objects when you update equipped items.\nAlso, doing this seems to make the application unstable shortly thereafter.",
