    "Description": "The last 3 version I have used the Armour value has been off by about 1k points but all the other stats were spot on.  Today though, using leggings of the broken beast both the Armour and the hp are off. I tried refreshing both armory and wowhead but nothing changed. When I put back on the Malfurion's leg armor of conquest (sp) the all stats besides the Armour value are spot on again. \n \nCan you help identify both issues, the persistent Armour value being over valued and now this one leg Armor?  All else seems ok.\n \nFirst time posting an issue so please let me know if I missed anything.",

      "Message": "It's probably because of your \"Broken Heart\" Trinket. RAWR averages out the armor proc from that trinket and adds it to your armor value. Also if you set the target level to 80, you should see values closer to what your seeing in-game.",
