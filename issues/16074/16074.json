    "Description": "No matter what I do, or what items I choose, I constantly get 140 more hp on rawr then on my my armory profile/in game stats. \nI have for example 48709 hp unbuffed now, but rawr shows me at 48849 for some reason. This has been the case for a couple of versions now, and didn't see any discussions about it. \n \nMaybe it's only my version that buged, but I doubt it, or something I'm doing wrong.\nRagingsoul  on Darsorrow. \n \nhttp://www.wow-heroes.com/index.php?zone=eu&server=Darksorrow&name=ragingsoul\nlinked the xml file",
