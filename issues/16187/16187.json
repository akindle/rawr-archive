    "Description": "The bonus from the Glyph of Lesser Healing Wave is only being applied to the bonus healing of LHW, not its base healing amount.  I confirmed this by taking off all my gear and buffs in rawr so I had zero spellpower and looking at the glyphs graph.  It had zero value.  As soon as I equipped a piece of gear with spellpower it had value again.\nÂ \nMaybe this is the way the glyph actually works, in which case I apologize, but I assume it's supposed to apply to the base heal as well.",
