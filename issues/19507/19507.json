      "Message": "Well currently in the system, I have set up as 800 RangedAttackPower, 10% chance on RangedHit, for 10 seconds with a 45 second cd. Now the 45 second CD can probably be set to 50 second cd since On Equip trinkets are running as 5 times the length of the duration (10 second duration * 5 = 50 second ICD). But I don't know if that applies to this enchant or not (I'm thinking it does).",
