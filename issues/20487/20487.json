    "ClosedComment": "We have some more Boss Handler changes coming in 4.1.04. All the Tank Models &#40;which are the ones that actually need incoming attacks, unlike DPS models&#41; have been set up to enforce a Default Melee Attack when there isn&#39;t one. TankDK specifically has already been set up to take Incoming Magic Damage into account when it is set up. You, the user, need to set the boss handler up for your content because we, the devs, don&#39;t know what you, the user, are currently running. The defaults have enough to get you going.",

    "Description": "To reproduce:\n1. Download latest Rawr version (4.1.3.0)\n2. Import character Alathas from Rawr addon (import text below)\n \nObserved:\nBoss Handler defaults (which I bet are untouched by 99% of users) start at Content: All and Custom boss.  That boss does no melee damage, which in turn leads to very low values for trinkets like Mirror of Broken Images (which provides magic resistance.)\n \nInterestingly, once I change the top options in boss handler I'm not sure I can ever get back to this default setting; the Custom boss will now have different values.\n \nOverall fairly confusing.",
