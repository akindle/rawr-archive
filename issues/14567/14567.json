    "Description": "On my Priest during an Ony run, I noticed that only one of my trinket procs were activating. I am using both the Mithril Pocketwatch and the Sundial of the Exiled. After going to Wowhead, I noticed that they BOTH use the same proc; Now is the Time!. I looked up the other Brewfest Trinkets and noticed that 2 of the 3 other trinkets share the same proc as their Honor Trinket equivalent.\n \nCurrently the first 6 trinkets that I mentioned are being treated by Rawr as separate procs. However those three sets share similar procs and need to be adjusted as such.\n \n[List]\n \nA: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49076 : Mithril Pocketwatch\nB: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40682 : Sundial of the Exiled\nP: http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=60063 : Now is the Time!\n \nA: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49074 : Coren's Chromium Coaster\nB: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40684 : Mirror of Truth\nP: http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=33648 : Reflection of Torment\n \nA: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49078 : Ancient Pickled Egg\nB: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40685 : The Egg of Mortal Essence\nP: http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=33953 : Essence of Life",
