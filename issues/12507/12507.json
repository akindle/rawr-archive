    "Description": "Tried to make a mix of T6 and T7 items for my holy paladin. The program only acknowledge one of the set bonuses though. Used head, legs, chest and pauldrons from T7 and boots, bracers, gloves and belt from T6 ... As far as I know this is a valid thing to do and Rawr should count both 2 and 4 piece bonuses?",
