    "Description": "I am using 2.4.4-alpha and Rawr 4.1.05.60775 debug build.  These were originally reported in the following enhsim issue: http://enhsim.codeplex.com/workitem/8295\n \nRawr doesn't export glyphs to enhsim.\n \nThere's also another Rawr bug, since it doesn't output the weapon proc correctly. It should be:\n \nweapon_set_proc agony_and_torment\n \nI didn't see the issue reported here after I reported them against enhsim.",

As of now, all three are not being exported.\r\n\r\nAlso note that some export values (namely Agil/AP and SP) may be inaccurate.  Should have it fixed in a couple of weeks (once my workload eases).",
