    "Description": "The tooltip for Blessing of Kings is confusing due to the way in which the buff has been implemented\n \n                Improvements = { \n\t\t\t\t\tnew Buff { Name = \"Improved Blessing of Kings\", Stats = { \n\t\t\t\t\t\tBonusAgilityMultiplier = (1.1f / 1.02f) - 1, BonusStrengthMultiplier = (1.1f / 1.02f) - 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBonusIntellectMultiplier = (1.1f / 1.02f) - 1, BonusStaminaMultiplier = (1.1f / 1.02f) - 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBonusSpiritMultiplier = (1.1f / 1.02f) - 1} } \n \nThis then shows in the tooltip as +7.84% buff when its +10% in reality. Its due to the fact that Blessing of Kings is treated as a 2% buff with improved being +7.84 multiplier of 2% = +10%. This affects all models.",
