    "Description": "For some reason, there seems to be something wrong with the gems in the latest version (for Enhance).  It continues to make BOP jewelcrafter gems available for optimization even though they are not selected as available.  It is also giving strange rankings for gems based on DPS (e.g. if I selected yellow gems and sort by DPS, deadly monarch topaz shows as the highest dps gem; which is obviously not correct.)",

The first one for my ret pally lists Bold Cardnal Ruby in EACH column. That tells RAWR that this RED gem can go into ANY socket, and sure enough when I run optimizer, it's slapping this gem into every blue and yellow socket it can find. I've turned off \"make available to optimizer\", add my own gemming, unchecked everything, engforce gemming, etc. I don't understand why they don't do a simple check to make sure the gem can fit into that socket, before they recommend it in the optimizer results.

Select you gems.\r\n\r\nIn almost every case (i do say almost), socket bonuses that are not from your best gem for DPS (Ap, ArP, Str, etc) are not better than gemming for the better gem and ignoring the bonus. If you reach a point to where 2 different color gems become very close in value, red and yellow, then Rawr will often select an orange gem with those stats in order to pick up the socket bonus. Blue sockets, ARE NOT, dps sockets. There is no stat on a blue gem (not including prismatic), that is worth it. So if your going for a purple, green, or even blue gem as a DPS, its half wasted.",
