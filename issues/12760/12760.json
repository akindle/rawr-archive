    "Description": "I am trying to figure out the optimal arcane cycles for my mage, however whenever I press the \"compute optimal arcane cycles\" button the program locks up permamently (I have left it running for 30 min with no change. When the program is locked I am still able to minimize the program and do other tasks on my computer. I have attached the file that I was using optimize the cycles, however I have tried it under a number of different gear and computation set-ups and the feature still locks up.",
