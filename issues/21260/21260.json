    "Description": "I was wearing my cat set, used the Rawr addon to load my available gear, added available items from the Molten Front, and made the changes necessary to optimize for Bear.\n \nAfter everything was done, I opened the optimizer and set it for Overall score, optimize food/flasks+mixology, max thoroughness. I ctrl-clicked the Optimize button.\n \nRawr pointed out two gems (Agile meta and a type of Demonseye) that I had in my equipped cat gear but are not in the Bear gem template. It asked if I wished to continue anyway, and I said OK. The next dialogue box popped up warning about too many options on certain slots, but I was unable to click it... and after a while the page reported that Silverlight had crashed.\n \nThis happened several times, while I tried to narrow the selection of items thinking that was the problem. Finally, I made available the two gems that were being flagged, and Rawr worked just fine.",
