    "Description": "I had a druid moonkin, and Rawr keeps selecting the \"Chaotic Skyflare Diamond\". I agree, but then it selects all red gems for all the other slots, which beats the purpose a little. It would be great if it had a constraint to select at least 2 blue gems (the requirement for this meta), or if it does not optimize - suggest a different working meta gem.\nÂ \nAlso, don't know if it already does it, but taking into account the gem bonuses items have would be great ...",
