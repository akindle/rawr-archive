    "Description": "Just looked at the spell cycles for my Arcane Mage with Moonwell Chalice and Soul Casket equiped. Both Trinkets are On Use and give a buff which lasts 20s, 2min CD. The 2 trinkets cannot be used together since they are On Use yet the spell cycles show both being active at the same time.",
