    "Description": "For the last few versions of Rawr, any time I try to build an upgrade list, it always locks up when it gets to the Rune of Zeth.  I've tried both WPF and online, my saved xml and importing fresh from battle.net.  I noticed it first when I was arcane, but it's now doing it for fire as well.",
