    "Description": "When I load in my BM hunter, name is Dakkon, on Icecrown. I receive this runtime crash and have to quit out, it looks like its carrying over the model selection from the previous character loaded. Maybe default a \"model reset\" whenever a new character is loaded to prevent a crash like this? :)\n \nSee the end of this message for details on invoking \njust-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.\n \n************** Exception Text **************\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\nat Rawr.Stats.op_Addition(Stats a, Stats b)\nat Rawr.HolyPriest.CalculationsHolyPriest.GetCharacterStats(Character character, Item additionalItem)\nat Rawr.HolyPriest.CalculationsHolyPriest.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character, Item additionalItem)\nat Rawr.CalculationsBase.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character)\nat Rawr.Calculations.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character)\nat Rawr.FormMain._character_ItemsChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e)\nat System.EventHandler.Invoke(Object sender, EventArgs e)\nat Rawr.Character.OnItemsChanged()\nat Rawr.FormMain.set_Character(Character value)\nat Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character, Boolean unsavedChanges)\nat Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character)\nat Rawr.FormMain.bw_ArmoryGetCharacterComplete(Object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\nat System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.OnRunWorkerCompleted(RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\nat System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.AsyncOperationCompleted(Object arg)",
