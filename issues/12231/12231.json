    "Description": "I just downloaded the latest version from the website (that claimed to be v2.1.4) and when I started it I got an update dialog and a pointer the website.  Tried downloading from another spot on the site and got the same file.  It is different than my old 2.1 archive, so here's hoping it is really 2.1.4 : )",

      "Message": "I suspect this is because the RAWR zip file contains a subdirectory name that includes the version of the app.  This means that any existing shortcuts that users create still reference the old subdirectory path even if you install a new rawr in the same place (ie  c:\\Program Files\\Rawr\\Rawr V2.1.6   vs.   c:\\Program Files\\Rawr\\Rawr V2.1.0 ).\r\n\r\nWhat Rawr REALLY needs is a setup utility that uninstalls any old versions and copies the files to the correct place in \"C:\\Program Files\" without any numbered subdirectory at all.",
