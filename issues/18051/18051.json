    "Description": "Using 2.3.18 and 2.3.19 with exactly the same gear/gems/enchants gives different stat values. In particular Armor Mitigation went from 2.53% to 0.50%. I also modeled in 2.3.18 Black Magic in the exact same way as version 2.3.19 does and there is still a slight difference in haste. Where do these differences come from?",

      "Message": "A few things changed in the latest release. First, there was a bug in the cat model that undervalued how much armor mitigated Armor Pen took off. Ast corrected that. Also there was a slight bug with the mangle debuff that he also fixed.  As for Black Magic, it could be the way Ast modeled the new trigger (MangleorShredorInfected instead of MangleorShred).",

      "Message": "As Hina mentioned, there was a slight armor penetration calculation fix (but that applied to all models, not just Cat). It was very slightly undervalued. (For those who want to know the details: It was calculating the armor penetration cap as if your target was 80, not 83 or whatever your target level is selected at. In .19 I fixed that function to take the target level in as well, but only Cat passes it in currently; for everyone else it defaults to 83)\r\n\r\nYeah, if you just manually added the Black Magic enchant as 250haste on MangleCatOrShred trigger in .18, you'll see a difference, since it's now on the new MangleCatOrShredOrInfectedWounds trigger. It can proc off the application/refresh of IW, so there's this neat/odd situation where the highest DPS spec includes 1 point in IW to increase BM uptime.",
