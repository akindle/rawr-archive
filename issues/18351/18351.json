    "Description": "The item buttons with enchants do not show correctly on some systems. The designer needs to be changed to work with some resolutions. The \"itemButtonItem\" button in ItemButtonWithEnchant.cs needs to be changed from \"Anchor: Top, Left, Right; AutoSize: False; Dock: None\" To: Anchor: Top, Left; AutoSize: True; Dock: Top\" and buttonEnchant needs to be changed to \"Anchor: Top, Left; AutoSize: True; Dock: Bottom\". I have attached a screen shot showing what the original settings look like and what the settings I suggested above look like.\n \nIn the picture the button settings are unchanged from their current public source. In the right picture I made the changes noted above.\n \nPS: This is for the client application v2.x, I have not checked the online version.",
