At line 83 in Rawr.Moonkin\\CharacterCalculationsMoonkin.cs, you have\r\n\r\nretVal.Add(\"Burst DPS\", String.Format(\"{0:F2}\", BurstDPSRotation.RotationData.DPS));\r\n\r\nand I think it's supposed to be\r\n\r\nretVal.Add(\"Burst DPS\", String.Format(\"{0:F2}\", BurstDPSRotation.RotationData.BurstDPS));\r\n\r\nHopefully there aren't other problems with the moonkin calcs that make it unreliable. I NEED this thing! :)\r\n",

I've been on an extended break from the program, and I'm only just now getting around to it.  It is just a display issue, so it's not terribly serious.",
