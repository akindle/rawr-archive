    "Description": "I'm fairly new this tool and I have to say it is a great guide to maximize my dps. I know this program wasn't intended to be used for characters below 80, but it's fun to mess around with anyways. When I load my character this error shows up on certain equipment even after I refreshed the data from armory and wowhead. Is there a way to work around this or is it something to work on?",
