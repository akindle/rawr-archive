    "Description": "In the main graph window it observes the setting as to the number of different gemmings to show for each item. In the individual item window from a click popup it shows every item with every gemming thus leading to a very long list and user complaints is this intentional? I'll code up a fix but I'm not sure if there was a reason for it being this way or simply an oversight?",
