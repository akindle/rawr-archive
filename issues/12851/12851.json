    "Description": "When checking the item list to find a possible upgrade the list appears empty.\n \nIf Ie. I press the icon on my head gear I get an empty list. But if I hover the mouse where I would normally select the item I still get the tooltip and I can select an item from this empty list. This happens when I use sort: Overall and Alpabetical. If I select sort::Mitigation then the list seems to work fine.\n \nSeems to only be a problem with then Tankadin module. If I load a mage into rawr this problem does not exist.",
