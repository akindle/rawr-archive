    "Description": "My DPS starts at 4339.\nWhen I switch to Unholy presence, then back to Blood (no other changes), it then says 4346.\nIf I check or uncheck any of the \"Refresh for ___\" boxes, it resets to 4339.\nIt happens the same regardless of which 'Refresh' options I have checked, except for when I have none of the three checked.\nÂ \nI know that's not a big margin, but a previous version of the character before some tweaks and upgrades was going from 3k-ish to 4k-ish in the same manner.",

So I think we're at the point where I need to tear down what's in there and get moving from the ground up again.  It should also adjust the effect of the performance issue which has been my primary focus lately.",
