      "Message": "Armory returns 75 emblems of triumph and Wowhead returns 1 emblem of triumph.     Returning the 1 is actually more useful as it allows you to filter them separate to the 232 items.    Neither of them mention the fact you also need a trophy.\r\n\r\nI really don't think there is too much that can be done about this without talking to Wowhead (unless the MMO-Champion data is better and that functionality is added to Rawr.\r\n\r\n",
