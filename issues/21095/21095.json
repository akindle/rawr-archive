    "Description": "Every time I freshly load my character (Rhandric, US-Azuremyst) for whatever reason (today I had to since I couldn't load from the repository), I have to be sure to mark the JC gemming template as available, despite both being a JC and having the gem equipped (yes, I know there's an option, at least from the Rawr addon, to mark gems equipped, but I prefer the gemming templates). Surely it makes sense that if the JC is high enough (assuming you can check that on loading) to mark the appropriate JC gemming template as available.",
