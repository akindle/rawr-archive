    "Description": "its being already discussion in the \"discussion\" but wanted to make sure its correctly logged as an issue here.\nÂ \nWhen updating the spell rotation list rawr hangs when the list gets saved. It seems to be somehow related to the \"shadowbolt\" as I can save the list without any issues as long as I leave shadowbolt in the spell priority list. the moment I remove it from the list the apps hangs when I try to save it.",
