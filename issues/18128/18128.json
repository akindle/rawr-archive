It's warning you that you have some items equipped that are not marked available, so they won't be considered for optimization.",

Ideally though, the green diamond should override the armor types selection.   You may not be aiming to have leather gear as a DPS warrioir, but if you have it you may as well use it.\r\n\r\n",
