    "ClosedComment": "Sadly, don&#39;t really see an issue here. As Shazear mentioned, the stats are adjusted for a level 83 target, which means you will never have the round 5&#37; Parry &#40;for example&#41;, as it is reduced by &#43;3 levels in Prot Warrior. The Health difference of 10 HP is basically 1 Stamina, which is a minor rounding error somewhere. Will try to track it down, but as Stamina calculations are changing slightly for Cataclysm, this is not likely to be an issue for the moment.",

    "Description": "Looking at my Tauren warrior naked and with no talents I see in Rawr Health is at 10737 for DPSWarr with mining and  10557 for ProtWarr with mining. WOW and Armory Health show 10547.\nAlso Rawr stats in ProtWarr for Dodge=4.35%, Parry 4.4%, Block 0%. WOW and Armor show Dodge=4.95%, Parry=5.00%, and Block=5.00%\n \nI also noticed while loading data from Character Profiler the professions are not transferred over into Rawr. I have to choose them manually in Rawr.\n \nI am attaching my character's Rawr xml file downloaded from the Armory and the Character Profiler for comparison. I know this may be redundant, but I would like to send them both just in case there are some discrepancies between each.\nI am also attaching the LUA file from the Character Profiler just in case this may help in you diagnosis\n \nI have contacted BrWarner about this and what information you made need to diagnose the issue. I have attached what he recommended.  If there is any other information you require please let me know.\n \nCharacter's name is Guurtag ,   Realm is Shattered Halls\n \nThanks",

Rawr has stats listed v 83 character since it's designed for end-game raiding.\r\nAlso, note, if you're naked, you won't be blocking because you have no shield.\r\n\r\nNot sore on the specific nature of the defect, but that would at leas point to why the % for dodge/parry/block are not what you expect.",
