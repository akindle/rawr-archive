Also, the set bonus from the \"Blessed Cleansing Of The Undead\" doesn't show up. I know it's only good for undead but it'd be nice to be able to see the calculations for this set.",

Not worth our time right now, but you can add them yourself. Open your BuffCache.xml file in a text editor, and look at how the other set bonus buffs are defined. The stat name you want to use will be \"BonusDamageMultiplier\".",
