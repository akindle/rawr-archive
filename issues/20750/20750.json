All the US characters will load. EU Characters are still getting the Arena advertisement so no, it hasn't been taken down. You clicked past it in your browser and a cookie was saved for when you use your browser to go back to the page. That cookie doesn't apply to Rawr's traffic and the server doesn't know how to click the Continue link to get to the character data.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of not having to compile this list myself again:\r\n\r\nJothay@US-Stormrage!\r\nGnorgnash@US-Norgannon!\r\nDresden@US-Destromath!\r\nBeafcake@US-Turalyon!\r\n\r\nOzzee@EU-Chamber-of-Aspects!\r\nBrujer%C3%ADa@EU-Chamber-of-Aspects!\r\nUghalcrash@EU-Burning-Steppes!\r\nTetsuo@EU-Draenor!\r\nTetsujin@EU-Draenor!\r\nTetsudai@EU-Draenor!\r\nDruwids@EU-Draenor!\r\nTeqlima@EU-Eonar!\r\nTequima@EU-Eonar!\r\nBergarac@EU-Forscherliga!\r\nNeptulon@EU-Hooglander!\r\nMangle@EU-Haomarush!\r\nWickedwrath@EU-Haomarush!\r\nArkhor@EU-Haomarush!\r\nEtai@EU-Moonglade!\r\nTootsi@EU-Moonglade!\r\nSahga@EU-Moonglade!\r\n\r\nThose are the characters reported so far and are what I'm using to verify this. I DO NOT NEED MORE CHARACTERS, AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK YOU ARE SPECIAL ENOUGH TO POST THE SAME CRAP UP HERE AGAIN.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I will not bother trying to fix it. I'm waiting on the JSON character data servers to go online and will totally rewrite how the server processes characters then (to parse JSON instead of the HTML page).\r\n\r\nAnd for all of you claiming you have no way to load your characters, did you not try the Addon? Did you not try just making the character manually? Ya making it manually takes longer but that's what saving the character file is for.",
