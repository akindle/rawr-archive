    "Description": "I optimized my available gear and I'm sitting at the poison hit cap (210 rating with Draenei + 5/5 precision + Misery) (well, 1 hit rating above it actually) and expertise capped (with a gem or two) and now the problem is that Rawr tells me to gem hit, go for items with hit etc. way more than I should. I'm running the latest version of Rawr (2.3.18)\nMy armory: http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stormreaver&cn=Skillpadde\nAnd attached is my character file.",
