      "Message": "Also, Rawr says Parry = Dodge when at 100% ctc (level 85), but I'm pretty sure that's not the case?  even above 100%, doesn't more dodge/parry push blocks off the table?  So at 100% dodge should still be preferred over parry.  I noticed this because my character is at 100.005% ctc and one of the reforges is from dodge -> parry, but if I take away the reforge, the \"Damage taken per second\" value does not change (it should because going into dodge pushes more blocks off the combat table)",
