    "Description": "My Paladin have this sword (lame, I know) but it doesn't load from Armory.\n \nI'm aware that it isn't BiS but since it was better than my previous one (Life and Death) and every caster already had it or something better, I took it. But now I can't check my stats correctly.\n \nIs this intended or is something that is possible to take a look?",

      "Message": "As a personal tick, it's not about being BiS, it's about having relevant stats.  It can certainly work for Healadins, don't get me wrong, but I think you're being a bit liberal with what \"Best in Slot\" means and implies.\r\n\r\nI'm done.  Glad you got it working through a quick fix.  Having a little Spirit shouldn't automatically remove an item from being compared (it will naturally lower the value by ignoring the irrelevant stat, be it Hit Rating or Spirit or whatever, without the need to entirely hide the item).\r\n\r\nA better check might be the requirement of having at least 2 relevant stats, as opposed to disqualifying an item based on the presence of one or two irrelevant ones.",
