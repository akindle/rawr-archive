    "Description": "The item Barbed Ymirheim choker is not being displayed in item comparisons, although it is an outright upgrade for my attached xml. This may involve rawr.rogue as well.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch rawr.\n2. Load XML file attached to this issue.\n3. In comparisons, select slot: Gear/Neck and note that barbed ymirheim choker is not being shown.\n   A. Addendum to this, if I disable all options in comparisons except for Dungeon (Heroics), the item is still not shown.\n \nAdditional Information: \nThis bug is also reproducable in Rawr v3.",
