    "Description": "Buffs -> potions currently shows potion of wild magic (200sp+200 critrating) about 5 times more powerful than potion of speed (500 hasterating) while having haste valued about 20% higher than crit by individual stats. Without any explanation for it being so, is it correct? Am i missing some magic way, 4,5% crit for 4,5% of the fight increases my dps by nearly 2%?\n \nI would use my best guess and suspect it was because of berserk, but the situation is the same for the prepot technique, and i'm not insane enough to pop berserk in the first ~5-10 secs.\n \nWould it also be possible to choose between what potion you prepot and what potion you take normally?",
