    "Description": "Jewelcrafters have access to unique gems, three of which may be equipped.\n \nRunning the optimizer suggests moving these gems to different slots, though this results in no actual change.\n \nI would suggest checking early in the optimization to eliminate identical permutations before spending the computing values. If not, at least check in the end before displaying the results to the user.",

You STILL have not mentioned the model nor posted example XML files.\r\n\r\nRe: \"checking early in the optimization to eliminate identical permutations\" the optimiser doesn't work through all permutations so doing a pre-check to eliminate some would be an overhead not a speed up. We have implemented some checks to eliminate this behaviour and thought we'd got most cases but as you are not providing the data for the case you can see we cannot fix your problem.",
