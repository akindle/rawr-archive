    "Description": "When I loaded my character, which has previously matched the Arcane talent template, the Talent build listed Custom (57/3/11). I saved my build in case the Arcane template changed, and switched to the Arcane template. When I did so it showed the template name as the build I had just saved. Switching through other templates (Fireball, Frostfire, Frostbolt) would revert to Custom using the specified talent build. I then loaded a different mage to make sure it wasn't an issue with my character file, the same behavior occurred.",

      "Message": "This usually occurs when the talent tree (or glyph tree) itself changes and the templates aren't updated. It's because it's trying to assign points the same way it was before but it can't so it sets the remainder however it can and marks it as Custom",
