    "Description": "In b6 when running optimizer, slots are being left empty with the new additional requirements.  Over-all, Heal Burst & Heal sustained seem to work fine.  But when adding any of the 7 new optimizer options, slots are being left out entirely (rings, trinks, weapons).",

      "Message": "I could reproduce this if I optimise for mana (for example) and I don't have any trinkets available that adds intelligence. Thus all my available trinket options will have no rating value. The latest dev build seems to place any random trinket in that slot. (The empty slots here are actually better, since it shows more clearly where items don't matter).\r\n\r\nEither way, I don't think this is a real problem, since you shouldn't be optimising for those stats in isolation. The idea is still that you optimise for some form of healing and only use a mana/mp5/haste constraint on top of that if really needed.",
