    "Description": "When loading this character file, Embrace of the Spider and Sundial of the Exiled will only show (and contribute) their baseline spellpower/crit values. Only clicking \"update from armory\" on them will add the on-proc component for display and calculation purposes, *even though the procs were already listed in their item properties*. This issue is not present in release 220b6.",
