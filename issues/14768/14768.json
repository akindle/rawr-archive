    "Description": "The resulting overall dps seems a bit inflated. From the earlier ~8.5k to 10.2k since the 39137 build.\n \nThe RAP is 11316 which seems high.\n \nTrinkets seem to show quite high dps value especially Death's Verdict both Normal and Heroic. I know they are good... but a 220 (n) 300 (hc) dps increase compared to \"Banner of Victory\" seems a bit steep.",
