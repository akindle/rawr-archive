    "Description": "Looking at the graphs for my resto druid, there is far too much gear being displayed. I'd like to be able to look at the list and easily see what are the best available upgrades for me.\nÂ \nAs such, I'd like to request a filter option to hide/show those items flagged as \"selected\" (ie: have a green diamond beside them). This would make the chart much easier to read, as I users could hide those items they have not selected and see only those they have flagged. This may make more sense as a checkbox above the chart, that's always visible (rather than a filter in the filter's dropdown).",
