    "Description": "I run optimizer and receive the following message:\nOptimizer Warning\n---------------------------\nThe following currently equipped items are not available\n    Shoulderpads of the Monolith gemming/enchant is not available\n    Conqueror's Nightsong Raiments gemming/enchant is not available\n    Valorous Nightsong Legguards gemming/enchant is not available\n    Valorous Nightsong Handgrips gemming/enchant is not available\nDo you want to continue with the optimization?\n----------------------------\nI have the made the gems available in optimizer (Green diamond) and the enchants/equipment are also available.  I've also made sure that rare, epic, and JC gems are available in the gemming templates.  It only seems to happen for gear that has rare gems equipped.  When I choose the same piece of gear with an epic gem installed, the corresponding part of the message clears.",
