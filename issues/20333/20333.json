    "Description": "I've been getting an error when attempting to download from battle.net. The error is new to me up till 2 days ago I could dpwnlaod character information without any problems though it may have been a week or more since I have last done that.\n \nI have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Error Message ==\n[Xml_InvalidRootData]\nArguments: ,1,1\nDebugging resource strings are unavailable. Often the key and arguments provide sufficient information to diagnose the problem. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=106663&Version=4.0.60129.0&File=System.Xml.dll&Key=Xml_InvalidRootData\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at System.Xml.XmlTextReaderImpl.Throw(Exception e)\n   at System.Xml.XmlTextReaderImpl.Throw(String res, String arg)\n   at System.Xml.XmlTextReaderImpl.ParseRootLevelWhitespace()\n   at System.Xml.XmlTextReaderImpl.ParseDocumentContent()\n   at System.Xml.XmlTextReaderImpl.Read()\n   at System.Xml.Linq.XDocument.Load(XmlReader reader, LoadOptions options)\n   at System.Xml.Linq.XDocument.Load(TextReader textReader, LoadOptions options)\n   at Rawr.Rawr4ArmoryService._webClient_DownloadStringCompleted(Object sender, DownloadStringCompletedEventArgs e)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\n[Please fill in steps here]\n \nThe only thing I have tried is a page refresh and to re-enter the character information for the battle.net download, since there was no suggested fix.",
