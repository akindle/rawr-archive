    "Description": "When looking at Relative Stat Values for a DK Tank, \"Defense\" is not listed nor (apparently) given a value. Even if Defense is at or above the uncritable amount, there is still a benefit to Defense, so it should have a value.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\nLoad from Armory: \"Wyntyr\" from \"Sisters of Elune\" server\nSelect \"Stat Values => Relative Stat Values\" from drop down menu\nLook for Defense....\n \nAdditional Info\nRawr Version unknown (Can't find it...) but using the online version\nWeb Browser: Firefox 3.6.3 for Mac (OS 10.6.3)",

      "Message": "I am looking for Defense Rating - the Defense Skill *does* show up in the list of stats in the summary area (in the middle of the 'paper doll' area) and it correctly reflects my gear there. I am trying to see how 1 point in Defense Rating compares to, say 1 point of Stamina, or Agility, or.... One question I have is if the relative value of Defense Rating is just not listed or if it is not being considered at all in the optimization routines. \r\n\r\nAlso - you are correct, I cannot get Rawr 2 to work on my Mac, so I only know of this on Rawr 3. If I get a chance, I will find a PC and check this with Rawr 2.",
