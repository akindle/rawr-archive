    "Description": "* Description - Figurine - Earthen Guardian, while not labeled Unique or Unique-Equipped, are effectively so. Indicating that you have one, because Stamina is favored so highly, means that Bear.rawr automatically tells you to get two of them.\n \n* Steps to Reproduce - \n1) Launch application\n2) Load character\n3) Mark JC trinkets as available for optimization.\n4) Optimize\n \n* Version Number/Additional Information - Rawr version 4.0.13.0b, hosted on Elitistjerks. JC trinkets are obtained by world-drop quest items, a la Damaged Necklace, but you only ever see one. Once I hit 475 JC, I nailed the Stamina trinket, the Agi trinket, the Int trinket, and the Spirit trinket all within half an hour's time. (I am a druid. I can only assume this is why I have yet to see the Strength trinket.)\n \n* Details - 4.0.13.0b\n \n* Attachment - Attach your character file that reproduces the issue.",
