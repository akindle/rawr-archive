      "Message": "Ah, looks like it's Cat.\r\nFirst of all, as the warning you get when you start the Optimizer says, you've got a *ton* of different items/gems/enchants selected, for almost every slot, which slows down and lowers the typical accuracy of the Optimizer. Try to limit what you mark available to only what has a remote chance of being useful (especially gems, since that increases the number of options exponentially).\r\n\r\nWhen I optimize that character, it does not choose Executioner. Almost certainly, your issue was just that you gave the optimizer a slew of different options, and/or used a low thoroughness. The optimizer's results aren't guaranteed; give it fewer choices, and more time, in order to get more accuracy.",

The more possible choices the optimizer has, the less accurate and consistent it is.
