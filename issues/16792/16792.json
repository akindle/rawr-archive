After locking some gemmings/enchants, I attempted to save the newly downloaded file, and received the attached error.  I tried again without making any changes to the character before saving, and received the same error.\n \nName/server:  Tychara / Earthen Ring\n \nI'll check back on this thread to see if there's any more information I can provide.\n \nThanks!",

I didn't know where that option was, but I found it and verified it was off.  The only settings I changed from default were to turn Gem Names and Extra Item Info on in the General Settings.",

The error I receive is the same whether I try to save the x.11 file to the new version, or if I download fresh data and attempt to save.\r\n\r\nI stress again, this is the x.11 version, so if that doesn't help, please disregard it.  I'm only uploading it because the Armory is currently down, so I'm trying to give you workable data in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThanks again.",
