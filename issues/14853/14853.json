    "Description": "I'm editing a Paladin I loaded from Armory, which originally had two points in \"Divine Guardian\". I wanted to do a total spec change, so began shift-clicking various talent points to remove them. I was able to remove all talent points, save for two - those in \"Divine Guardian\". I was even able to remove the pre-req talent, \"Divine Sacrifice\" without concern - and all other Prot talents. I put them back in, tried to remove it again, couldn't. Pretty much, those two points are just 'stuck' for some reason. Everything else works fine.\nÂ \nMac, Standalone.",

No matter how I played with it, the only way to clear it was to select the preset 0/0/0 spec and start with a fresh slate.",
