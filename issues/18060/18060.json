    "Description": "Rawr want's my Combat rogue to use dagger/sword instead of sword/sword. To be specific it picks Unsharped Ice razor (MH) & Nighttime(OH) as being better then Nightime(MH) & Liar's Tongue(OH) Version .18 does not make this same mistake. It seems like the rotation picked generates much more damage then it should be (some back-stab and SnD rotation).\n \nEdit Jun 25, 2010:\n \nIt seems like Rawr is not estimating enough damage for eviscerate, therefore it is choosing a weaker rotation (one with out eviscerate). Read comment, view .doc attachment for more info.",
