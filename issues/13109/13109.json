    "Description": "When starting Rawr under mono on Ubuntu, version 2.2.1 gives the message:\n \n\"Rawr was unable to load the Item Cache. It appears to have been made with a previous incompatible version of Rawr. Please use the ItemCache included in this version of Rawr to start from.\"\n \nWhen checking the ItemCache.xml file it appears to have been cleaned out except for the header. Tried replacing it with the one from the zipfile and try again. Same thing happens. Then I load possible upgrades from Wowhead or Armory to fill it again, and it works fine for that session, when I check the file it is filled. But the same thing happens the next time I start Rawr.\n \nEverything used to work just fine with 2.2.0.b6 and older versions.\n \nOnyx.",

Anyone else know of anything that might be causing this then?\r\n\r\nOnyx, is there any way you can run Rawr from a debugger? I don't know if there's a copy of VisualC# or similar for Ubuntu, or if VC#'ll just run on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the ItemCache.xml file, while Rawr is closed, does it have the data in it? ie, is it a loading problem, or a saving problem?",

Tried with 2.2.1 in the default \"Rawr v2.2.1\" directory (as opposed to renaming it to \"Rawr\" which I usually do) and it gives two errors:\r\n* first the infamous \"The current BuffCache.xml was made with a previous version of Rawr.....\"\r\n* secondly the \"Rawr was unable to load the Item Cache. It appears to have been made with a previous incompatible...\" message.\r\n\r\n2. For good measure I tried 2.2.0b6 again and it loads like a charm showing me a load of items even before I load any character from the Armory.\r\n\r\nHope that gives you some more info.",
