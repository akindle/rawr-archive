    "Description": "The other day, I tried loading from the armory my new DK (with at the time mostly starting area and HP greens). However after loading, it gave me an error. I closed RAWR and tried re-loading. Now every time he splash image shows up, I get a critical error message:\n \n---------------------------\n \n---------------------------\nRawr encountered a serious error. Please copy and paste this into an e-mail to cnervig@hotmail.com. Thanks!\n \n \n \n \n \nValue of '13083' is not valid for 'Value'. 'Value' should be between 'Minimum' and 'Maximum'.\n \nParameter name: Value\n \n \n \n   at System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown.set_Value(Decimal value)\n \n   at Rawr.DPSDK.CalculationOptionsPanelDPSDK.LoadCalculationOptions()\n \n   at Rawr.FormMain.set_Character(Character value)\n \n   at Rawr.FormMain.get_Character()\n \n   at Rawr.FormMain.Calculations_ModelChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n \n   at Rawr.FormMain..ctor()\n \n   at Rawr.Program.Main()\n---------------------------\nOK   \n---------------------------\n \nI've sent the email but I haven't heard any reply from him. Since then I've had to reinstall my RAWR. I even tried to reload my character from the armory again and it worked fine.",
