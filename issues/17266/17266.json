    "Description": "Previously, with a new release of Rawr, I would disable the default 'Epic' gemming templates and create a single, custom blank gemming template.  Having done so, this selection would hold true until the next upgrade.\nÂ \nWhen I do this now, however, each time I launch Rawr, it reverts to the original configuration and has no recollection of the blank template I created.  This appears to be true across all classes (and doesn't seem like something that would be module-specific, in any case).  Perhaps a config file isn't being properly written?",

I'm not a big raider and have limited funds so I currently stick with rares, but I have to deselect the epic templates each and every time I load any of my toons.",
