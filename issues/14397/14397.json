    "Description": "I haven't looked in detail, but I get a NullReferenceException from GetBaseStats, line 29. What happens is one thread already sets _lastLevel, _lastClass, _lastRace and _lastForm, but did not yet compute the _lastStats, the next thread then goes in and expects _lastStats to already be set and to be correct.\nÂ \nTo reproduce start Rawr with class already set to Mage, then change to Warrior for example.",
