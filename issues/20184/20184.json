    "Description": "From mage forum on EJ:\nÂ \nNoticed today that Rawr was valuing the 359 [Bell of Enraging Resonance] higher than the 372 version as it had the internal cooldown on the 359 at only 75 seconds. So I went and tested on the target dummies and it appears that the 359 ICD is 100 seconds - same as the 372 - and following the 5x proc duration pattern.",
