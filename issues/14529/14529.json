    "Description": "First of all, thanks for all the work on this fantastic tool.  I had an idea for small enhancement and figured I'd throw it out there.  I had downloaded the latest version and hadn't fixed my filters yet, so I had quite a few items in the Comparisons panel when I loaded my toon.  I was scrolling down to my currently-equipped item and realized that the header which shows the legend for the colored bars had scrolled off the screen. \n \nWould it be possible to keep that top part static so you could see it no matter where you were in the list?  It's easy enough to fix by remembering what the colors are, but as I'm switching between various characters I forget sometimes which ones are which.  Fixing the filters to limit what you're seeing also works.\n \nAnyway, small thing and maybe it's been addressed before.  Thanks again and I'm looking forward to Rawr3!",
