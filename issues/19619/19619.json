    "Description": "On the right side of mine, it shows Chaotic Shadowspirit Diamond being the best gem as a meta for me as a frost mage (I'm guessing for most mages as well).\n \nHowever, on running the optimizer, it doesn't show up to change since I currently have the Ember Shadowspirit Diamond in it.  Not only that, it's saying that in order of Chaotic gems, the order is:\nSkyflare with a large lead\nShadowspirit with a serious drop\n \nQuite different from what the right side shows.\n \nAttached is a screenshot.",

      "Message": "The comparison chart on the right disregards the requirements. The dropdown chart for picking gems does and so does the optimizer. On its own Chaotic gem is better, but to get it activated you'd generally have to sacrifice too many stats to make it worth it. Regarding Chaotic Shadowspirit and Chaotic Skyflare I think one version (not sure if current one) had wrong requirements for the Chaotic one.",
