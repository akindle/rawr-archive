    "Description": "I'm building off 35211, The elemental shaman optimizer keeps freezing part way through the optimizatin process.\n \nI was previously building off 35201, but had manually applied the patches that went into 35204, and 35211. It would ocassionaly lock up, but not consistantly, and not when I had put all my buffs on. At that time I did not have Valorous Worldbreaker Gloves ( item level 219 set gloves ) http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=45406. Now it locks up every time. Unfortunately I'm posting this from work so don't have my proper character.\n \nI'm running it on windows 7 64 bit, built using the new visual studio beta (i'll have to check the number from home ) I tried turning on break on all exceptions, but nothing seems to be being thrown ( other than when I load my character or switch from resto to elemental in rawr )\n \nIf I wanted to debug why it is breaking where is a good place to start? is there debug logging to see why the optimizer might be freezing or what step it is on? It seems to break in different spots depending on if I say I have arcane intellect, or moonkin buffs. I'm guessing this is only the genetic algorithm randomly picking a different character?\n \nDoes it make more sense to post my character somehow and create an issue for this?",
