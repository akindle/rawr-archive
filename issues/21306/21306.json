    "Description": "When I load my arcane mage (who has 2/2 Incanter's Absorption), turn on Use Boss Handler and choose T12 10N The Average Boss, all the boss damage events that come up are physical. When I change the one that affects ranged DPS to fire, total DPS stays the same, even though I'd expect it to be higher because of Incanter's Absorption. This is true whether or not I check off Use Mage Ward in the Survivability tab.",
