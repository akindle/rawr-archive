    "Description": "There are two default templates for the Boom model: - \n \nSP(red), SP(red), SP(red)\nSP(red), SP(red), SP/SPIRIT(blue)\n \nI would have expected at least the 2nd template to have a green/yellow/orange gem to allow the possibility of activating a strong socket bonus.   Also, I was a bit surprised by the lack of +Hit gems in the template as for my toon (putting a boom set together from my current resto set + a few pieces) hit is the most important stat and not having it in the default template can alter the ranking of the items significanlty.\n \nIt may be that is intentional - i'm somewhat of a Boomkin novice, but having used Rawr for a LOT of different classes an specs, it stuck me as unusual.",

      "Message": "Let me add my voice to this. ilvl251+ gear usually has a socket bonus worth it for yellow sockets, which means +SP/+Crit or +SP/+Haste, depending on the rest of the gear (usually +SP/+Crit at this point). Green sockets usually are not worth it, so red gem is mostly the best choice (except for the meta).",
