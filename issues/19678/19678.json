    "Description": "I'm multiboxing five mages in Cataclysm heroics and I've been looking a way to select right content in Rawr, so the hitcap would be perfect for level 87 bosses.\nNot sure if boss handler is built for this, however changing the level there does not affect at all.\n \nI have simluated hit rating increase by adding required hit rating to one equipped item, so I reach 17.00% and relative stat values drop hit rating off the list as intended. \nThen if I go and try to reforge items, it still suggests me to reforge stats like mastery, haste and crit rating to hit rating. Even when I am \"hit capped\".\n \nAlso, when editing items and adding hit rating to shirts, does not affect. I had Sawbones Shirt equipped with 10000 hit rating on it, re-equipped the shirt but I still\nneeded hit rating due to spell stats and relative stat values.",
