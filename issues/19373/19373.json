    "Description": "Ember Shadowspirit Diamond appears a little low in the relevancy of the meta. When compared to other metas it has the same relevancy as 51 Int and 2% threat reduction and 51 int and 10% silence reduction. I'm thinking it's a problem with BonusManaMultiplier stat. That particular stat appears to be calculated correctly in the calculations, just doesn't appear to be useful in the graphs. One would think it to be rated higher than Forlon and Bracing Shadowspirit Diamond just it seems odd.",
