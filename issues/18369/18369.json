    "Description": "When new versions come out, I like to reload my toon from CharProfiler then reload from Armoury just to make sure none of the old stuff causes hiccups. I then proceed to save my talents and setting gemmings to single versions as well as double checking items listed and enabling options in general settings (show info, show names etc). Once all of this is done, my next step is to select my self-buffs (drums, 30% ICC, etc) then check to make sure the scrolls/elixirs/potions I usually carry are the best for me. The problem here is that none of the potions show (or have ) any effect on any values although they seem to be in the same order as the older versions.\n(BTW, Tanking is my offspec so my gear is far from ICC end-raiding.)",
