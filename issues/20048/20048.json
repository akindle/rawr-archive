    "Description": "Somewhere there's a bug in how Stamina rounds causing Rawr to be 1 stam higher than it should (for some values of Stamina only).  This can be verified by loading a blank prot pally, set the professions to mining and enchanting, equipping Ring of the Battle Anthem and assigning the +60 Stam enchant.  This should result in a Stamina of 714 as it does in game, but it reports 715.\n \n156\tbase\n120\tmining\n286\tring\n60\tenchant\n \nI think the game applies a separate 15% buff to each bonus and rounds down so the values become 179 + 138 + 328 + 69 = 714.  If they are summed then rounded you get 715.3 so I suspect the error happens somewhere in there.  Looking through the code it seems like every value gets rounded down (floored?) separately but I can't really follow it.\n \nEdit:\nFurther tested to remove the enchantment value from the equation.  I equipped a 4 Stam item and have a 321 in game Stam.   That's 156 base = 179.4, 120 mining = 138, 4 ring= 4.6, yielding 322 versus 179 + 138 + 4 = 321 \n \nEither the gear or the base Stamina are not being floored correctly.",
