    "Description": "If I try to load Rawr at: http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php, my browser freezes and then crashes (tried it with FireFox 3.6 and 4.something Chrome 9.0.597.19 beta and Opera 11). At first i thought it was a Silverlight Issue, so i uninstalled it and installed the Newest version (Microsoft Silverlight Version: 4.0.51204.0). Well the Problem stayed the same. Once i received a Message telling me something like \"Rawr needs more memory please refresh the Page and then click YES if your asked for more Memory\". But i never got the request. The Memory seems to be caped at 1MB, so i think this is the reason why i cant start Rawr, but i got no Idea how to fix that as i can't chance it manually in Silverlight UI. Opera Error log in the Attached File.",
