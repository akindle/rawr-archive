    "Description": "I was optimizing my Boomkin today, when I noticed something I believe to be odd behavior. This discussion is concerning T12 Normal gear levels, so I'll be excluding heroic trinkets from this post.\n \nAccording to this post ( http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t110353-balance_cataclysm_4_2_a/#post1953583 ) and the OP of the same thread, DMC:V and Necromantic Focus are supposed to be BiS T12N, with VPLC coming at a very close second. However, when I open a blank Rawr profile, VPLC is shown to be miles ahead of Focus and DMC:V. \n \nSince the information I'm seeing directly conflicts with the chart on EJ, I'm wondering is perhaps VPLC is overvalued in some way, or if the information in the EJ post is too out of date (it was made just last month, and I don't recall any changes made to trinkets).",

I merely meant that I hadn't done any item edits, and that the information/steps to recreate could be done from just opening a blank Boomkin and inputting your gear.\r\n\r\nI've attached the profile in question. From what I can tell, VPLC is about 300 \"points\" ahead of DMC:V, and roughly 200 \"points\" ahead of Focus.\r\n\r\n",

I don't know quite what to tell you; trinket math is a very unusual discipline, and despite my best efforts, things always come out differently between the three sources.  I'm not going to close this straightaway, as I will take some time to look at how WrathCalcs handles the VPLC before I come to a final conclusion.",
