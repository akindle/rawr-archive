      "Message": "I'm sorry , but I read on the latest notes and open issues warlocks were \"almost entirely accurate and fully functional\" aside from pets.  Trinkets and Procs are not pets so this was still an issue in regards to model that is still a work-in-progress.  The only reason I brought this up was in case this was an oversight since I was under the impression that procs were modeled through the Base not through the Module.",
