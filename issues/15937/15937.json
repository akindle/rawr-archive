    "Description": "I'm having a problem with the dps score Rawr is showing. It says my dps is 7951.3 dps (7953.66 score), but when I optimize (with incremental optimizations disabled), it says my current dps score is 8013.055. The optimizer also suggests a setup that is slightly lower than that (8012). Any ideas why it's doing this?",
