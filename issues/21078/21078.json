    "Description": "The Moonkin model's stats graph gives tick box options for Strength, Agility, Attack Power & Expertise on the elitistjerks.com/rawr.php version 4.2.0.0 I used today 4/7/11. However the actual graph graphs Intellect, Spirit and Spell power so I suspect a labling problem rather than a stats problem. Expertise does still graph expertise, which isn't that good a stat for Moonkin :)",

It may however not have changed the text for the boxes so it might be that other models have the form and still have the Enhance Agi/Str/AP/expertise style of things.",
