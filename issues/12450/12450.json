    "Description": "This issue was in 2.1.7 as well for me.\nBasically, anytime I add any additional Optimization conditions, mainly Hit and expertise, optimizer will not find the said results, start optimizing with a value of -(some number) and stay that way the entire optimization. When it finishes and I agree to replace my gear anyway, I see that my gear has been replaced with pretty much junk, and things are removed. No head enchants, no chest enchants, lesser weapon enchants, no leg enchants, rings and trinkets left blank, etc.\n \nBoth the requirements for my Bear already exist before I even optimize ( Hit > 90 and Expertise > 90) and my soft cap of 160k I can all easily reach with my current tanking set, but rawr refuses to optimize it correctly with one or both of those conditions.\n \nI've attached my char xml below",
