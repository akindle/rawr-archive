    "Description": "OK I'll be the first to ask the stupid questions.\n \nMy hit and expertise rating numbers are the same (or very close) between the Armoury and imported toons into Rawr4 @elitistjerks however the percentages for misses and dodges are significantly lower than caps (though Armoury, spreadsheets and theorycrafts say my rating is good). Don't have my hunter called up atm but i beleve Rawr shows ~2% instead of 8%. This holds true for my Fury warrior and retribution pally except they are also expertise capped but Rawr shows ~4% dodge. I can usually work around little details but this skews ALL gear recommendations.\n \nCharacters are on Akama and are Turambar(Fury), Brituck(MM), and Bristef(Retribution)\n \nWasn't sure if I was being thick-headed or if something is actually wrong and I haven't saved nor changed anything from fresh load. But I should be able to post Char. files if needed in the next day or 2.",
