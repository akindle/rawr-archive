    "Description": "Currently, several Rawr modules are very very far behind other alternatives as far as accuracy is concerned.\n \nI think that implementing a Generic module that allows people to input stat weights, a class (for set items), and weights for the various set bonuses would be extremely useful. I know Rawr is strictly not for using stat weights and all of that jazz, but theres a niche for a powerful gear optimizer to accent the other WoW projects that do create stat weights.\n \nA Generic module should be relatively easy to create, and will be an extremely useful addition to Rawr for thousands of people, even if it goes against some core principles of Rawr. The gear optimizer has been, in my opinion, the most useful part of Rawr. Only a few modules have ever been as accurate as other efforts.\n \nThank you for your time",
