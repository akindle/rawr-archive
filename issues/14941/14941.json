    "Description": "In WoW, the Seal of Command (SoC) is design to hit up to two additional targets. In Rawr, if I use SoC as a retribution paladin and I remove from the rotation the AoE skills (consacration, Divine storm), by increasing the number of oponents to 2 or 3 (or more) the overall DPS is not changing nor the SoC DPS value. This proves that the multi-target component of the seal was not modeled and the request is to add it in a new Rawr version. From my tests on ingame dummies, the seal damage is not splitted on multiple targets but is identical on each one. Basically the seal does 3x times the DMG if 3 mobs are arround.",
