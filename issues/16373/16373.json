    "Description": "Seems like the FCFS Simulator is completely broken in 2.3.9.\n \n1.) Using only one rotation:\nYou can configure anything you want, the DPS will not change.\n \n2.) Using multiple rotations:\nThe stats tab will always show one specific rotation dropdown index as the chosen rotation, even if other rotations are for sure better. I'm not completely sure which one because for my saved character it's always the first, but if I load a fresh character from the armory and add a second rotation, it's always the second.\n \nThis all worked in 2.3.8, I just retested it.\nI also tried a fresh install of 2.3.9, still the same problem.",
