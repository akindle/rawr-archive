    "Description": "I imported the justice point costs (from the Import menu) and made several items that cost justice points available to the optimizer.\n \nI then ran the optimizer with the restriction of cost being less than or equal to 2200, but the results contained items with a total cost exceeding 2200.\n \nI've attached my current character file and one with the optimizer results loaded.\n \nI can provide more detail if needed.",
