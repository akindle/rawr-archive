    "Description": "Looking at the value of fallen crusader on Tank and DPS DK modules, and I find that it's 0 on TankDK because when I go to accumulate the special effect, I get a negative value. Further research showing this for any PPM based effect. Passing in a negative value into accumulate should be signaling the accumulate function that we're working in PPM rather than default Chance per trigger type event.\nÂ \nI know there are functions that handle the PPM, but not seeing them utilized in the accumulate.",
