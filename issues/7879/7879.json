    "Description": "Would it be possible to calculate a threat weighting as well?  It would be a separate rating, not something combined into the mitigation/survival numbers.  \nÂ \nThe threat rating will allow people to get a better \"tanking\" perspective of their gear and possibly choose different gear that would be a downgrade or sidegrade to their current tanking setup.",
