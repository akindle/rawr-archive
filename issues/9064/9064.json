    "Description": "I downloaded and opened up Rawr! Checked it out a bit and haven't gotten to the point where I am ready to use it. So I removed it, however, I keep getting a \"Profile < Rawr!> loaded successfully!\" message when I sign onto to ALL of my characters. I have attempted to search through my WTF folder to find the culprit of this \"profile\" being loaded, but to no avail. \n \nI just glanced over the Rawr notes on the Druid Wiki and haven't been able to find where it says that Rwar would modify my \"program files\" in any way, so I am not sure why I am getting a profile being loaded IN my game. I was under the impression that the gear and whatnot was enabled from the armory site and had nothing to do with accessing my physical character. \n \nMaybe it's was my mistake in assuming that it wouldn't alter some type of files, even though I didn't install it on my computer, it is an application, however, I want to remove this profile from my game. So please tell me how I can do that.",
