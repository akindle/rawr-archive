I also added a lot of useful theorycrafting information into the tooltips to make it easy to spot differences between Rawr.Warlock vs DrDamage results incase something changes, or if I have missed something.There will be some differences with the AOE spells though, but those are not important because you would not be using AOE spells in your pve boss rotation anyway &#40;aoe spells are just included to give an overall picture of warlock damage&#41;.",

Its not exactly the same layout as DrDamage, but very similar, which makes validating the results a piece of cake!!\r\n\r\nI did discover a mistake in DrDamage though - currently it does not take into account the 5% increased spell damage from demonic pact (meta/ruin locks)] - but apart from that (and some very minor differences due to rounding), the new Rawr spell values are matching DrDamage :)",
