    "ClosedComment": "Refresh the item from WoWHead or Armory to fix, this should not occur again as it shouldn&#39;t have a special effect in the first place.  Please re-post the issue if this occurs in the next version, as it might point to other issues with other totems and how they are being parsed.  For now, it only appears to be an error on Totem of the Bay, since Steamcaller&#39;s Totem has the same text and is being parsed correctly.",
