Not sure why this would be happening - seems very strange :)",

      "Message": "Found the problem, it's the fact that it's got 2 special effects on it, one to trigger from damage and one to trigger from Healing. The healing trigger is what's killing it.\r\n\r\nWe're gonna discuss this as a dev team on how best to handle the situation, because really it should be one special effect with 2 triggers (and we don't have code for that).",
