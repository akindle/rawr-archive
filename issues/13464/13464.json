Going to try to add an option to the option panel, since its possible to get into that situation &#40;most commonly when you are undergeared compared to the rest of your raid&#41;.",

In particular \"Runescribed Blade\" isn't showing up, but competes for Best in Slot.\n \nI think it has to do with the fact that spellpower and crit rating are maybe stats and not wanted stats.",
