    "Description": "Very minor thing, but when RAWR finds an update and pops the dialog saying \"Do you want to go to the website\" clicking yes does nothing. Firefox3 is my default browser and I have IE6 as well if that makes any difference.\nÂ \nAnother minor thing related to the same subject - there doesn't seem to be an option to turn check for updates off. Be nice to have.",
