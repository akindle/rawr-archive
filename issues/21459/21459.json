    "Description": "Recently, like one or two weeks now, I'm having trouble using the optimizer. I cannot get it to finish an optimization, because it crashes at random percentages during the process. The optimizer popup window simply freezes. If I click the cancel button it usually gives me another popup with the suggested gearset at that point of the optimization process. I can tell, because it's different between tries. I am usually not able to close the window. It just does nothing when I click close or the cross.\nÂ \nI'm using firefox, but the problem also occurs in internet explorer and in the downloadable version of RAWR.\nI'm using the current version of RAWR which is 4.2.4.\nI'm using a Windows 7 64-bit machine with an Intel i7 and 6 GB of memory.",
