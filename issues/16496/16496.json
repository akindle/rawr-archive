    "Description": "It seems that, if you turn on the 3.3.3 mode, rawr doesn't even consider that you could use FFB on BF proccs. (    * Brain Freeze: This talent now allows your next Fireball or Frostfire Bolt to be instant and cost no mana. There is a small internal cooldown to keep the Frostfire Bolt from immediately triggering Brain Freeze again.)\nWould be nice to see some numbers for it in a future release.",
