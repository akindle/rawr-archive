    "Description": "I realize this is a niche, low priority issue, but thought I'd let you know just the same.  On large, full-respec type optimizations, in which basically every slot is changed to some extent, the Print feature does not fit them all on one page, nor does it spill over to a second page.  It simply cuts off.\n \nI generally only use the Batch Tools, with Fire as my primary optimization, and Arcane as secondary.  I discovered the problem when I was investigating a switch to Arcane as my primary, which necessitated a change to literally every single item, 15 in total.  When I printed the results, it managed to get 12 full items on the printed page, and clipped the rest.  I then tried printing to a PDF, which managed to get 13 full items, but still clipped the weapon and ranged slots.\n \nAs I said, I realize that this is a niche problem; most people will not have 13-15 slot changes on a regular basis, but I appreciate you looking into it.  I really like the Print feature, and I'm glad you added it.",

Rescaling reduces the size of the image on the page, but the list is still cut off at 12-13 items.",
