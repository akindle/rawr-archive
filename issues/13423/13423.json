I've attached a picture showing the final Optimizer results screen, with two insets -- the summary showing my score and dps, and the summary of my score and DPS that show up in the bottom of the Rawr window. I've also attached my character's XML file.",

      "Message": "Ah, my apologies, it seems this is not a bug so much as an ambiguous label. In Rawr's main form, \"Score\" refers to DPS+Survivability (for mages anyway). In the picture above, you can see the main form states my \"Score\" is 6142.62. When I optimize for DPS (which is 6140.33 in the main form), the Optimizer correctly returns the number 6140.33, but with the description of \"Score\", which I misunderstood. It's a shift in definition of what \"Score\" is between the two forms.",
