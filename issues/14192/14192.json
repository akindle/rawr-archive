    "Description": "Check out the attached .xml. It claims that 1 strength contributes 18 DPS when it should be 1.8.   Item evaluation is equally broken. (Items with plenty of strength being shown as being twice as good as they are)\nÂ \nIt would seem that it's tied into rage calculation somehow, as checking \"Glyph of Heroic Strike\" on returns my expected DPS to normal along with the valuation of items and strength.",

      "Message": "I did just check in a lot of issues with rage calculations.  I unfortunately didn't see this issue until now, where I don't have my development environment available to test. You are seeing an issue where the code didn't think you had enough rage to do any heroic striking due to a bug where we were setting HS usage twice.  I'm pretty sure it's fixed for the next release, but I'll leave this open until someone can confirm it.\r\n\r\nThat second bug, the \"different\", is related to the first -- Heroic Strike is displaying properly, but Overall DPS isn't including HS because it thinks you can't afford it.",
