    "Description": "I have a DW Frost DPS DK, and 2.2.14 seems to be QUITE off.\n \nIn 2.2.13, it says I should be putting out about 29XX DPS, which is about right after spending quite a bit of time on the dummy getting used to the rotation. As soon as I load up 2.2.14 and load the same file, it says I should be at about 45XX or so with everything being the same. I even tried reloading the character from the armory and it had the same anomaly. It seems to have CRAZY high numbers for my frost strike for some reason.  It says frost strike alone accounts for 1920.88 DPS (40.4% of my damage)!!\n \n \nAlso, I noticed a bit of oddity when screwing around in the rotation menu. When I load up my character, it will say 3021 DPS. If I change presence to blood, it drops to 2999, but if i change it back to unholy, it shows 2941 until I check and uncheck the ghoul option. It then goes back to 3021. I am not changing ANYTHING other than what presence I am in.......\n \n \nJust a bit of feedback. I may be doing something wrong, but all my settings seem to be in order (buffs, glyphs, talents).",
