    "Description": "I would like to be able to lock an enchantment to an item in the same sort of way that gems can be locked.\nThis would help when trying to optimise off spec.\nie I have a main spec Shadow Priest with an off spec of Discipline(which I also use in BG PvP)\nI make multiple items available in the optimiser including the already optimised kit from the SP spec with gemming locked\nIf I then optimise for Discipline with the relevant enchant(s) available - the optimiser will select an \"already optimised for Shadow\" item and change the enchant if it is better than the other item(s) I have made available to the optimiser",
