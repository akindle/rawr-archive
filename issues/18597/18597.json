    "Description": "I'm trying to figure out where to spend my emblems of frost. So I do the following:\n \n1. Enable filter for special currency emblem of frost\n2. Tools -> Item Cost Load Emblem of Frost\n3. Check that T10 set items and their cost are correctly displayed in the item comparison window\n4. Set optimizer requirement Cost <= 500 (this should give it plenty of emblems to buy anything remotely useful)\n5. Run the optimizer at max. thoroughness\n \nThe result:\nThe optimizer selects all the non-set iLvl 264 items available, including the sigil and trinket. My existing T10.5 gloves are replaced by the non-set gloves. No T10 items are selected at all.\n \nI've repeated the above with different numbers of frost emblems, ranging from 60 to 800 but no T10 item is ever selected by the optimizer.\n \nI've also tried reloading the character from the armory in case there was anything wrong with my existing .xml file, but the result was the same.",

      "Message": "Well, if I simply mark all T10 pieces as available and drop the cost requirement, then the optimizer at least tells me to use the T10 headgear and shoulder piece. So the problem is probably related to the cost requirement.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm not sure about is the importance of the 4T10 set bonus. It is listed under Buffs -> Set Bonuses with a value of 1795 points. Looking at the total value of a single iLvl 264 leg piece like Pillars of Might (over 30.000 points), this would mean that as soon as you can upgrade a single item from 251 to 264 (roughly 5000 points difference), the set bonus loses out in the optimization process. This way, wearing 4T10 would only become a viable option after upgrading all pieces to T10.5",

      "Message": "well, the real bug that I can find by running your optimize is that it's choosing things to equip that aren't marked as available.  With nothing added to your available list, as found when I loaded your character, you should only see the best option of your available items.  So it should never equip the Badge chest, hands or CSK. As soon as I mark the T10 pieces as available *AND* remove the Cost requirement in the optimizer, it suggests the 4T10 as I would expect.  So I need to figure out why the cost requirement is different.",
