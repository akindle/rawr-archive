    "Description": "The racial ability of +5% base health really only does apply to base health.  Rawr is currently applying the multiplier after adding  sta and equipment contribution.  You will get the correct results if you change the base health for Tauren to 3614 and remove the multiplier.  I've tested this with an untalented & ungeared lvl 70 tauren (wow reports 4464; rarw says 4498; rawr with changed base value and no multiplier says 4464) and with a talented and geared tauren (wow reports 462 sta, 8234 health; rawr currently says 8457 health; rawr with changed base vaue and no multiplier says 8234.  I have not tested with full raid buffs but from the tooltip and these two data points, I'm pretty sure that new base value and no multiplier will fix health.",
