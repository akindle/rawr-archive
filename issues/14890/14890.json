    "Description": "I have the Polished Dragonslayer's Signet (Onyxia head quest reward) marked as available to the Optimizer in the Shadow Priest module. When I run the Optimizer, it has me equipping the ring in both ring slots. While the ring is NOT explicitly labeled as unique, one can only complete the quest once; having two of these rings is impossible.",
