    "Description": "OK, I realize this might well be user error.  But the hunter stat calculations seem broken in my setup.\n \nI'm using a survival build, and \"update from character profiler\".  But there are strange things going on with Relative Stat Values\nand Gem calculations at the very least, and probably deeper problems too (equipment rankings don't make much sense to me).\n \nI've attached a screen shot of relative stat values (stats.png) and gem rankings (test.png).  Notice how MP5 is ranked at -53.59.  I could see how MP5 might not be highly rated, but how could it be negative?  Agi is .52, but ranged AP is 17.47?  That doesn't seem right.\n \nIn addition the gems are strange too (test.png): Delicate Cardinal Rubies (20agi) is 7.51, Delicate Scarlet Ruby (16agi) is greater at 8.43, but Delicate Stormjewel (20agi again) is -20.26.",

This is a side-effect of the present rotational method and I can't do anything about it until I completely rewrite the system, which I'm not read to do yet.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as we already have Hunter issues open for similar circumstances.",
