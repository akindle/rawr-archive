    "Description": "Looking through the issues I do not see anything that covers this. It would be nice if the filter setting could be stored per saved file instead of globally. I use Rawr! for multiple toons that are in different stages of development. I have a druid that has a moonkin spec and a bear spec. I like to disable by iLvl in order to speed up the optimization. However, I always have to rememebr to go and set the ilvl correctly.\n \nI also play a warlock every so often and he is way behind the curve compared to the druid. I have to check a bunch of stuff to be certain that I am generating a complete upgrade list for him.\n \nIf the values were saved per .xml file, then people would have the correct set of filters when the toon opens up.",
