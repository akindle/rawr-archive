    "Description": "Hello!\nÂ \nThe most tell-tale and easily repeatable proof of this is to put any amount of talent points into Critical Mass (Tier 5 fire tree) and notice no difference or change in DPS. The fire tree adds 9% total to fire crit (most fire builds) and none of this seems to be considered for DPS. Critical mass alone adds 6% fire crit.",
