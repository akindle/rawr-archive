    "Description": "In BossHandler.cs is this code:\n \n \n        private double UNDER35PERC = 0.10d;\n        public double Under35Perc { get { return UNDER35PERC; } set { UNDER35PERC = value; OnPropertyChanged(\"Under35Perc\"); } }\n        private double UNDER20PERC = 0.15d;\n        public double Under20Perc { get { return UNDER20PERC; } set { UNDER20PERC = value; OnPropertyChanged(\"Under20Perc\"); } }\n \n \nWhile I understand that UNDER35PERC should be less than 0.35 since it's expected that less the boss will be less than 35% health for less than 35% of the fight (due to heroism/bloodlust among other things), 0.10 seems too low.  In any case, I would expect UNDER35PERC to be a larger value than UNDER20PERC.",
