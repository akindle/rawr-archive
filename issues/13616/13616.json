    "Description": "When trying to add drain soul into a rotation, it won't actually ever get cast assuming there's something else needing to be cast more often than once every 15 seconds. One example of this is a rotation of Haunt + Corruption + Drain Soul. Drain soul does not get cast. This leads to the incorrect result of hast being completely irrelevant. It looks as though there have been multiple attempts to get Drain Soul implemented that have been baked out for one reason or another in the code.",

I've seen my DPS shoot through the roof on a long boss fight when I can let it tick as my filler when the boss is below 25%.  The only problem is that right now there seems to be one filler possibility and that's all.",
