    "Description": "I have added additional enchants in EnchantCache.xml, but they are not available to select when editing my character in Bear model. Even if I manually edit the character's XML file to change the enchant, it is not visible and its stats are not included. I am trying to add the various resistance armor kits for modeling my tanking of Hydross the Unstable's adds.\nÂ \nIt appears the enchants (or at least \"valuable\" stats from enchants) are hard-coded in the model DLLs.",
