    "Description": "There are three items in the item cache for 4.1.5.0 called \"Vicious Gladiator's Armwraps of Triumph\", with item numbers as follows:\n \n60598\n60597\n60588\n \nThey'd be quite nice Bear bracers, except that they don't actually seem to exist in-game.  Wowhead doesn't give a source for them, either.\n \nThe Alacrity (60594) and Accuracy (60591) bracers do seem to exist.",
