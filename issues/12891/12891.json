    "Description": "If you use Tools | Edit Item... then click Add... button and enter an item id eg: 45866 with defaults ticked. It will go off and try to load item from Armoury. Since that item id doesn't exist on the armoury it raises an error. All good so far.\n \nProblem is that Armory.cs calls StatusMessaging.ReportError but the Status Message dialog box isn't open. \n \nThe code goes on to invoke StatusMessaging_StatusError in Status.cs which does check a variable \"IsDisposed\" which I am guessing is meant to check if window exists. The problem is that IsDisposed is false at this stage so it happily tries to call \n \nInvoke((RefreshErrorListDelegate)RefreshErrorList, args); \n \nand throws an exception \n \n[System.InvalidOperationException] = {\"Invoke or BeginInvoke cannot be called on a control until the window handle has been created.\"}\n \nNow I'm getting the hang of reading the code these days but I'm not entirely sure about this one. Is it that IsDisposed should initialise to true? And that failure to initialise it is causing this failure?",
