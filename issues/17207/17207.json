    "Description": "Currently, vendor items can only have a gold cost plus one token type in their cost.  Contrast this with faction items which can handle items with gold, rep, and multiple token type in their cost.  An example vendor item which Rawr does not currently deal with correctly is: http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=51149.  For this and other vendor items which cost 2 (or more) token types, Rawr only records the first token type it finds.\nÂ \nWowhead update suffers from a related issue.  Since it uses the underlying VendorItem it can also only track one token type for vendor items but do to the way it operates, it only tracks the last token type found.",
