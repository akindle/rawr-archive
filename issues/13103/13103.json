    "Description": "I'm strangely having problems using rawr now ( i used it times ago with no problems).\nBasically now i can't even start the program since when i formatted my pc.\nEvery time i try to start rawr i get an error that says:\n\"Rawr.exe - Application Error\"\n\"Application not correctly initialized (0xc0000135). Press ok to close the application\"\nÂ \nBasically i'm thinking i lack libraries of some sorts that rawr need to work but i can't find what i need, is rawr developed in some particular system or those it need some framework/dll's installed? ( that i probably had before formatting for some reasons i don't know)",
