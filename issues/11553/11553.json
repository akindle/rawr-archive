    "Description": "When I equip 4 T5 pieces, I obtain no dps increase, despite the crit bonus on steady shot (which is of course included in my rotation). I think it's a bug, since this bonus used to give me quite a huge increased dps in the previous versions of Rawr (actually I have this since the 2.0.2).\nThe same thing applies for the Ashtongue Talisman of Swiftness, every time I have to set manually the mean +AP bonus, according to the spreadsheet found on Elitists Jerks.\nÂ \nHere is the XML file.",
