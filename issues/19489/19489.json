    "Description": "On loading a character from battle.net, mouse-over for the two items Tia's Grace (heroic) and Arrowsinger Legguards shows \"0 [stat] -> [stat]\".  Clicking the reforge button shows the available options and correct amount of rating to be reforged.  On load, these numbers aren't being counted in the simulation:  Rawr shows I have 22 expertise (436 rating), but the in-game character sheet shows 25 (532 rating), the difference being exactly the number of Mastery reforged to Expertise on Arrowsinger Legguards.\nÂ \nSimilar problems will require user monitoring until fixed in Rawr:  I had to select \"Not Reforged\" and then the correct reforging until these stats showed correctly in the sim.",
