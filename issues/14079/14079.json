    "Description": "When 2 gladiator set pieces are used, the bonus resilience is being calculated as 35 instead of 50, resulting in a display of 15 less resilience than is actually present. Furthermore, the set itself isn't listed under 'Set Bonuses' (presumably for all models, but in this case, for the Mage model), yet it is (albeit inaccurately) being calculated.",
