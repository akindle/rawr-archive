      "Message": "The survivability model for mage module is based on the chance that you'll die before the healers can react. You can see this at the bottom of the info panel in survivability section. Most likely cause for 0 value is if you set the incoming damage too low or too high. At one case you won't die regardless of resillience, at the other extreme you'll die anyway no matter how much resillience you have. So you should find a soft spot in the middle that represents what you want. The default healer response time is 5 seconds, so raw damage should be somewhere in the ballpark of your health divided by 5. So you probably have too much damage in that profile. Also the crit rate should be set as value between 0 and 1, so 0.3 in your case. Let me know if you need further help in getting this working the way you want.",

No settings in the survivability tab can alter the item comparison list's value for resilience rating.  The list ignores resilience entirely.  If it weren't for the high amount of stamina on pvp pieces, I have little reason to expect even the optimizer to select items for their resilience.\r\n",
