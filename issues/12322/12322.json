    "Description": "Using a tanking build that does not have improved shred but does have improved mangle the best rotation for me is still coming out has Mangle+Shred+Rip+Roar5.\n \nThats fine, the gear evidently makes shred still good even though it costs a pile.\n \nThen I go to buffs and click mangle always on.  If anything I expect to see Shred+Rip+RoarX since Shred is being shown worthwhile and I wont need to mangle anymore.\n \nInstead I get Mangle+Rip+Roar5 which makes no sense at all.  If shred was worth using over mangle for CP it should replace mangle completely if mangle is always up.\n \nAttached char sheet.",

      "Message": "Perhaps the problem is that with shred so expensive its good enough for some CP but not good enough for all CP since it will take too long for it to generate the right number.  The optimizer may be then saying, well, then shred is out, and going to mangle only.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the real optimal rotation given mangle always up is still to get half your cp from mangle half from shred or some such.",
