    "Description": "For hard coded gemming templates in the models could we have a Description or Name field please.

You have to hover over each gem to identify what it is, even then you get no indication why the model author placed the gems in that config. If you check the source code its often clear what the model author was thinking as their is a comment but the end user never sees this intention for the gem grouping.",
