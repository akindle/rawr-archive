    "Description": "Hard one to peg down here.  I loaded up Rawr, loaded up an old tanking profile for my DK tank, and refreshed it from armory.  I noticed for some reason, the 40 stam wrist enchant was getting a very high amount of mitigation attributed to it, to the point where it beats out the 102 stam fur lining (which had no mitigation attributed to it).  The same thing was shown for the 10 stats to chest enchant, gaining an impossible amount of mitigation, putting it over the 275 health one.  My character has both of these \"bugged\" enchants active on my items at the time.\n \nChanging what was being displayed on the Comparisons pane did not affect this.  But toggling off the \"Use Multithreading\" option immediately corrected the problem.\n \nSince then, I have been unable to reproduce this behavior, even using the same profile.  Sorry I can't provide more info.",
