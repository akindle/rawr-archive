    "Description": "The \"Edit Item Filters\" dialog contains only pre-WotLK filters: Sunwell, Tier 6, Tier 5, Tier 4, etc.\n \nIF this feature is actually intended to limit the items shown on the item selection lists...\n \nPlease update them to include Naxx10, Naxx25, etc plus Tier 8, 7.5, 7 items.\nI would also suggest including non-heroic and heroic instance filters.\nPerhaps even WotLK World Drops vs. TBC World Drops vs. Old World Drops.",
