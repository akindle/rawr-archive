    "Description": "1. Sigils imported from Wowhead are still given the item type \"None\".\n \n2. \"Sigil\" is not listed as an item type in the drop-down in the Item Editor.  As a result, Sigils imported from Armory show an item type of \"Two-Handed Sword\".\n \nPatch 2862 contains fixes for both of these.  (Ignore the patch for Rawr.Base/Armory.cs since this has been obsoleted.)  If preferred, I can roll a new patch and resubmit.",
