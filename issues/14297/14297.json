    "Description": "Other than using \"all\" which shows off-faction loot and all kinds of garbage, tribute chest items for 10m and 25m do not display even with a refresh of the item ID under any default filter.\nÂ \nA fresh pull should probably be made for 2.2.20 regardless as the 2.2.19 pull had lots of items without faction information attached cluttering lists.  A click->refresh on that item made it go away but...it was prevalent enough that it's probably worth a mass-refresh before next version.",
