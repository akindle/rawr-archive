    "Description": "When 'Maintain Scorch' is enabled, Bloodmage's Regalia 2 Piece DPS drops from 199.47 to 0. Disabling (unchecking Maintain Scorch) reverts it back to its proper DPS. Overall DPS drops by 279.19 -- from 7341.87 to 7062.68, which means Maintain Scorch is a 79.72 DPS difference... so it's not completely breaking to just leave it unchecked, but it is a problem nonetheless.",
