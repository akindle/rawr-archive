Parsing upgrades Rawr DK recons that Sigil of Deflection are worth more than 3 milion points for upgrade while I have at present Sigil of Insolence equiped. I though only recently started using Rawr as I PUG raid and only recently got a trophey and I'm not sure what to spend it on, thus my available gear is rather the gear I though needed to select to be used for potential upgrade list.",

RS goes negative, and so anything with RS trigger goes negative as well.  The default Blood rotation is running a 10 pt RS deficit and when it balances the numbers go all wonky. \r\n\r\nI'll see if I can patch this without having to do the whole rotation re-write that I have scheduled.",
