    "Description": "When I optimize my DPS, I used to use Hunter DPS as the main optimization and Hit Rating as the additional requirement to get the highest dps while ensuring that I am hit capped.\n \nWith 2.2.27, the Hit Rating optimization was removed and \"% Chance to Miss\" was added instead.\n \nNot knowing how it works, I first tried to optimize without using % chance to miss as the additional requirement. The results came out with a nice dps rating, but I was not hit capped which was a problem.\n \nI assumed that I would never want to miss, so I put 0% in the \"% chance to miss field\", and when I clicked optimize, my Rawr program encountered and error and had to be closed.\nI tried both \"Less than or Equal to\" and \"More than or Equal to\" and still received the same error.\nI also tried using numbers 1-8, receiving the same error every time.\n \nI've included my character file. Hopefully this helps, thank you.\n \nNanaya of Boulderfist.",
