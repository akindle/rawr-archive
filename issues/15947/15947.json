    "Description": "For some reason the Whispering Fanged Skull trinket is showing a lower dps output for the 264 ilevel version than the 251.  I personally changed the crit strike rating and moved it up slightly on the 264 version and the dps actually went down some, so i'm assuming there is an issue with the crit strike modifier.",

      "Message": "Notes from your Char File:\r\n- You are exactly 1% over your hit cap (Cap is 8%, you are at 9%) and yet some of that is coming from Gems/Enchants. Best to replace those with better stuff\r\n- You are set to the default Boss Settings, I would very much recommend changing that to 'The Average Boss' as that will help give value to movement and impedance breakage and show you a more realistic DPS value.\r\n- You have a TON of trinkets marked as available to the Optimizer, best to take all those ones you would never wear as a DPSWarr off. That alone would reduce number of Trinkets marked by *14*.\r\n\r\nAll the above said, looking at your Trinkets list, I see WFS-264 at the top and WFS-251 at 4th in the list.\r\n\r\nThis looks to be an issue on your end. Do you not see the Proc effects on both items?\r\n264 - Base: 148 Crit Rating | Proc: 1250 Attack Power (15 sec 35% on Damage Dealt/45 Sec)\r\n251 - Base: 131 Crit Rating | Proc: 1100 Attack Power (15 sec 35% on Damage Dealt/45 Sec)",

      "Message": "It must have something to do with a setting because after re-downloading it, the fang was now correctly placed.  As for critiquing my set-up thank you, but i knew i was 1% over.  It wasn't what i am currently wearing but was just comparing a the bonus.  Actually wearing the gauntlets of Bitter reprisal hence the hit gems as my hit is lower.  Still not exactly sure why it showed the 251 ilevel higher, but it fixed itself.  Because now 264 fang is highest, where as before Death's Choice was actually.",
