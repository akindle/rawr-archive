    "Description": "I see that Rawr gives Turalyon's Helm of Conquest [232] a DPS value of 706.68 for me, while the helm of Triumph [245] is only 559.61 (with identical gems).\n \nSince the upgrade has a boost of every stat the Conquest piece has, things seem a bit off.",

      "Message": "Open Options, Misc, click \"Stat Graph\".\r\nNotice how the black haste curve evolves.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening here is that adding 10 haste rating is causing a sharp 200DPS drop. This is caused by how abilities get used if you're 'perfect' at following the FCFS priority.\r\n\r\nIf you click the ECD graph button, you'll see how that small bit of extra haste causes a rather radical chance in abilities usage.\r\n\r\nIt's one case where a 'perfect' calculation of ability usage based on a sim can result in whacky results. \r\n-> Working as intended ™\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself having being at one of these edges of a radical DPS shift caused by haste, the best you can do is slightly modify the 'delay' setting in the rotation tab. This will shift the edge to the left or right, and if it's shifted by enough relative comparisons between gear will make sense again.\r\n\r\nDon't worry about this in game, you aren't perfect enough at following the rotation to actually get these sort of sharp edges in your dps done.  The 245 help will definately improve your DPS by a small amount :)",
