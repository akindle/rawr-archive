    "Description": "I'd like to be able to load my character from the armory, enter my 50 or so items, start up the \"optimise\" function, and then select the stats to optimise for.\n \nExample, I'm going to be a druid in cat form but I need 10K health for a particular boss fight while maximising my dps. Which of my gear should I use?\nExample, I'm going to be a druid in cat form in battlegrounds. Maximise my crit rating while keeping my resilience above 300.\nExample, I'm going to be a druid in bear form tanking hydross. I need 250 resistance to nature while remaining uncrittable, maximising armor and health.\nExample, I'm going to be a druid in tree form. I want to maximise mp5, then spell power.\nExample, I'm going to be a druid in moonkin form. I want to maximise my mana pool, my crit, and spell power.\n \nEssentially, I'd like to be able to select a series of stats, apply rules to them, and possibly weighting (eg, 300 resilience is a rule, but mp5 > spell power is a weighting)",
