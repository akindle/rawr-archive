    "Description": "i'm not a coder but i know that the math is wrong for the steady shot as bm, if it goes below 1.5 secs. you cannot fire a steady shot more often then every 1.5sec regardless of haste rating, i searched the current issues to see if there was a similar post to this and didnt see one so i thought i'd bring it up, is there a way to put a fixed min value in for steady shot so that if it falls below 1.5 it returns 1.5 to the calcuations?  i know alot of hunters are going to be specing away from BM with the new changes but it would still be nice to have correct, \nÂ \nThank you for all your wonderful efforts i love the program. \nStyhl - Stonemaul",
