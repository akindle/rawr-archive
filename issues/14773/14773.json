    "Description": "Whenever I'm in the mage section of Rawr I cannot go to Options tab as it crashes. This is irrespective of whether I've opened a saved .xml, loaded from the armoury or created a new mage with an empty gearset.\n \nI'm attaching a text file with both the message from the dialogue as well as the stack trace that gets printed.\n \nI'm running Rawr through Mono 2.2 on OpenSuSE. \n \nI suspect it's only an issue that happens through Mono.\n \nI'm sure I selectted the Mage section of it, though can't seem to change it. Or maybe it didn't give me the option to select a component.",

Looks like it's still broken.\r\n\r\nI attached what Mono told me. Looks like maybe a problem with a \"ScrollableControl\" of some kind? Don't have time to look at it at the moment.\r\n\r\nSomething odd though, it did ask me if I wanted to save before it died, maybe it's catching an exception and calling the regular exit procedure? I'm not really familiar with Rawr's inner workings yet.\r\n",
