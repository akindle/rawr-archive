    "Description": "I find whenever I get a quest reward Ring or Trinket which upgrades me, Rawr will double equip it. Sicne these items can only come from a quest, they should probably be set as only able for one to be used.\nÂ \nWould be good if Rawr would recognize the \"Reward from <quest name here>\" text as something that makes the item unable to be equipped in both slots at the same time, since tit's impossible to do.",
