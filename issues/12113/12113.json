    "Description": "Whenever I select \"Chart: Gems > Normal\" or \"Chart: Gems > Meta\" in order to get a chart of gems listed by rating, Rawr deletes all but a few gems in those categories. I first noticed this in the Moonkin model, but I haven't checked the other models yet so it may be affecting them as well.",

      "Message": "Unless the filters apply to every single screen in the entire program all at once, then no, they aren't being filtered. The application works as normal until I try to view gems as items in the large pane on the right-hand side, and then only a select handful (usually old BC gems) actually show up. After doing this, whenever I try to change or add a gem to a socketed item, the only gems that show up are the few that were listed in that window. It deletes literally ALL of the meta gems in the list, every single time like clockwork.\r\n\r\nI tested this 5 or 6 times to make sure that's what's happening, and every time deleted the folder completely and unzipped a new install fresh from this website. I noticed that the ItemCache folder gets smaller after the gems go missing, which seems to indicate that they are indeed being deleted and not just filtered.",
