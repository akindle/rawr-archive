    "Description": "Hi, I noticed that dodge is not being properly calculated in bear.\n \nI created a char from scratch exactly as my in game bear (armory ain't working again). I put the talents exactly as I have them and made sure I was a night elf.\n \nAccording to rawr I should have 35.39325% dodge, whereas in game I actually have 37.04% dodge. The agility values rawr displays and wow displays are EXACTLY the same (wow displays 421, rawr displays 421.88), and I'm sure I didn't forget any enchants.\n \nI had to add 35 agi to 2h weapon and 12 agi to boots to make up the difference, but obviously then my agi is not the same as in game.\n \nAlso tried changing target level from 73 to 70 and even though it makes a difference, it's hardly noticible at all, just pushes dodge up from 35.39325% to 35.99325%.\n \nIf I change to Tauren and keep target level as 70, is shows 35.62522% dodge, meaning there's roughly 1% difference between the two (35.62522 + 1% = 35.9814722). However, Quickness now reads \"Reduces the chance that melee and ranged attackers will hit you by 2%\" (yes, I do realize that even 35.62522 + 2% won't even be close to 37.04%).\n \nAnyway, hope you can have a look at this. Thank you",
