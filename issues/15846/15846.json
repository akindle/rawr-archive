      "Message": "I'm aware of the problems with querying the armory.  This issue is more that it doesn't cancel gracefully, which should be doable regardless of if a connection can be made with the armory or not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue will be fixed when we can connect to the armory; I'm not sure.  Regardless, from a \"bug tracking\" position, this is a different issue :)",
