    "Description": "While the visual display of changes is nice and appealing, I think it would be more functional to have an optional itemized list of changes available. Something like:\n \nChest (Yellow) - Runed Cardinal Ruby --> Reckless Ametrine\nChest (Blue) - Runed Cardinal Ruby --> Purified Dreadstone\nChest (Blue) - Runed Cardinal Ruby --> Purified Dreadstone\n \nIt'd be easier to make optimization changes to your gear this way.",
