    "Description": "Minor issue, but base stats for retribution paladin are a little off.  Listed below are my base stats from armory/ingame vs when imported into Rawr, with all buffs unchecked:\n(armory/ingame vs Rawr)\nStrength: 1839 vs 1840\nAttack Power: 4385 vs 4407\nCrit Chance: 30.30% vs 25.50%\nDodge Chance: 0.25% vs 0.19% (taken from having Seal of Corruption up, giving 25 expertise (6.25%). 6.5%-6.25%=0.25%)\nAttack Speed: 3.08 vs 2.98\n \nAll these discrepencies seem to be throwing off final numbers after buffs, etc.  Anyone else able to verify this or replicate this issue?\n \nhttp://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Lightninghoof&n=Heng",

      "Message": "Str/AP will be slightly off due to rounding issues. 20ap difference is significant enough that it's not rounding though, so there's something off slightly there.\r\nCrit is correct; you get 4.8% less crit against 83s.\r\nExpertise does work in fractional portions, despite what the character screen says.\r\nAttack Speed difference sounds like a missing buff? ie, Swift Retribution?",

Unchecking Bloodlust brings speed to match what's listed on my character screen/armory.  I appreciate the work you guys do and the attention to details in your work.  Thanks from a devout user.",
