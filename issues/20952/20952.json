    "Description": "Hi!\n \nFirst, thanks for doing a great job on the warlock parts!\n \nMy problem is that I have done some optimization on my gear and am trying to import it to the rawr addon with /rawr import. Every time I get the message \"Invalid rawr data entered please check you have copied data from Rawr to clipboard with Crtl-C\"\nThis I have done and even compared the cliped and pasted data so it is identical. \n \nMy char is EvilAcroo@ EU Kul Tiras.\nRawr client version: 4.1.5.0\nAddon version: 0.66\n \nAny advice would be great :-)\n \nThis is the data I'm trying to import:",

Saying get character from repository is not useful as the problem is likely to be in the way you load/save a particular character file. \r\n\r\nI need specifics you hinted that it worked one way but not another can you give step by step instructions so that I can actually repeat EXACTLY the steps you take and thus duplicate the issue. If I cannot duplicate the issue I cannot fix it.",
