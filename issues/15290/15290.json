    "Description": "Rawr.Shadowpriest is currently showing the old tooltips and probably counting the wrong DPS values from Glyphs\nThese glyphs were changed in patch 3.3.0:\nGlyph of Mind Flay: This glyph now increases the damage done by Mind Flay by 10% when the target is afflicted with Shadow Word: Pain.\nGlyph of Shadow Word: Pain: The periodic damage ticks of Shadow Word: Pain now restore 1% of the priest's base mana with this glyph.\nGlyph of Shadow: While in Shadowform, this glyph causes non-periodic spell critical strikes to increase spell power by 30%, up from 10%, of the priest's total spirit for 10 seconds.",
