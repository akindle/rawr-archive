    "Description": "Thunder Capacitor text is \n \nEquip: You gain a Thunder Charge each time you cause a damaging spell critical strike. When you reach 4 Thunder Charges, they will release, firing a Lightning Bolt for 1181 to 1371 damage. Thunder Charge cannot be gained more often than once every 2.5 sec.\n \nHowever WowHead comments say that the cooldown is only after the last charge.  This makes it sound like you will get a proc every fourth crit, except that crits within 2.5s of the proc don't count.  It looks like this was implemented for Moonkin (and probably mage, but I didn't look as closely).\n \nThe actual behavior is that after you get four charges, you still need one more crit to get a lightning bolt.  There is a 2.5s cooldown after the proc.\n \nFrom WWS\n \n  0:00'14.985 Erdluf Starfall hits Archavon the Stone Watcher for 1070 Arcane.

In the Moonkin spell.cs, (I'm looking at r32524) the following code:\n \n                        if (timeBetweenProcs < 2.5f) timeBetweenProcs = timeBetweenProcs * 4.0f + 2.5f;\n                        else timeBetweenProcs *= 4.0f;\n \nboth occurences of 4.0 should be changed to 5.0.  At my gear level, that will push TC below 100 SP trinkets, such as DC: Illusion.\n \nIn mage spell.cs I suspect a similar change should be made:\n \n                float avgHitsToDischarge = 4f / avgCritsPerHit;\n \nthe 4 should be changed to 5.",
