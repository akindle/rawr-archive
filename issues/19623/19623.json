    "Description": "1.) The physical component of the strike doesn't miss in 4.03A\nThis was confirmed at http://maintankadin.failsafedesign.com/forum/index.php?f=6&t=29319&rb_v=viewtopic&start=390\nwith parse http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/2035lkwd484k3nry/details/0/\nNaked Player with shortsword - Auto attacks being dodged/parried and missed.\nEVERY single HOTR STRIKES (not novas) hit.\n \n2.) The Nova Component uses Spell Hit\nDon't have WoL evidence for this but can be easily recreated.\n \nMe - No Gear -  \nSpell Miss on Level 85 Training Dummy - 0%\nMelee Miss on Level 85 Training Dummy - 5%\nAll - Hotr Strikes AND Novas hit.\n \nMe - No Gear - Spell Miss on Level 88 Training Dummy - 7.65%\nMe - No Gear - Melee Miss on Level 88 Training Dummy - 8%\nHotr Strikes - All Hit\nNovas - Roughly 8% of Novas Miss - No Dodges or Parries\n \nIf Novas couldn't Miss we would see no misses on both.\nIf Novas uses MELEE Hit - wed see misses on the 85 Dummy\nIf Novas use SPELL hit - Wed see no misses on 85 and ONLY misses on 88 Dummies\n \n3.) Considering the above evidence seems to show Nova using Spell Hit,  An assumption of using Spell CRIT as well is not unreasonable.\n \n4.) Rule of Law affects BOTH components Crit\nI am currently seeing even when naked a crit ratio of 15%+ on both portions of the HotR\nCurrently RoL only effects the Strike Component currently in Rawr, the Novas average dmg doe not go up as more points are added.\n \n5.) Hotr Glyph not modeled.\nCurrently seems to be a 10% increase on dmg of BOTH parts of the ability.\nThis was recently hot-fixed as it wasn't doing both when first released on Live",

      "Message": "I'll look at the spell hit stuff, but HotR's physical component most certainly can miss.  On top of that, there is no combat log entry for it missing, either, which makes it difficult to detect.  I verified this by making a macro:\r\n\r\n/cast Hammer of the Righteous\r\n/stopattack\r\n\r\nAnd in front of a training dummy, when you hit the macro and HotR misses, all you'll get is the melee swing and the confirmation that you gained 1 holy power.",

      "Message": "I looked over this and HotR seems to be modeled accurately, except for Rule of Law and the glyph.\r\n\r\n1) See previous post.\r\n2) Since the physical attack can miss, which results in the proc not even trying, HotR's proc can miss twice.  The spell miss is modeled in AbilityModel.cs, while the melee miss is modeled in AttackModel.cs.\r\n3) Spell Crit is applied to the proc in AbilityModel.cs.\r\n4) I fixed this. :)\r\n5) The HotR glyph was modeled, but not selectable in the interface.  That was fixed earlier today, and should be ready for the next release.",

      "Message": "Reopened!\r\n\r\n4.0.6a introduced the following:\r\n\r\nThe area-of-effect attack of Hammer of the Righteous no longer has a chance to miss secondary targets when the primary attack hits the paladin's target. If the primary attack of Hammer of the Righteous fails to hit the target due to miss/dodge/parry/block, no enemies will be affected by the area-of-effect attack.\r\n\r\nSo now, HotR can miss the physical attack, which in turn causes the magical attack to never fire, while the magical attack is no longer affected by spell hit rating and will always hit if the physical attack hits.",
