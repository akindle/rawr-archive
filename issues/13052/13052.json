    "Description": "It appears that druid base spell crit is missing.  Talented but ungeared, The in-game paper doll is showing a crit of 2.69% but Rawr has the Crit at 0.84%.  Fully talented and geared, Wow shows a crit of 19.32 while Rawr has a crit of 17.47%. Since both of these are off by 1.85%, I suspect that's a base amount that should be accounted for somewhere.",
