    "Description": "As I've finally gotten around to make a rogue, I though I'd try making a gear list with rawr for him - but looks like it's treating my rogue as a druid - listing items and especially weapons that is druid oriented - unless ofcause rogues suddenly can use staves and 2handers:) I've just tried downloading rawr again, to see if I'd messed something up with the setups ( haven't tickered with them but you never know:P )... Any suggestions to fix it?",
