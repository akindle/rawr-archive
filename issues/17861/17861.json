    "Description": "The default behavior is that the optimizer treats all gems in the selected gem templates as available. This works for all the built in templates but not for the custom templates.  I've checked this for a couple of models.\n \nEquip an item with a strange gem ie Bold Cardinal Ruby for a Mage. Then make a custom template which includes Bold Cardinal Rubies.  When you hit optimize, the message comes up saying that \"The following currently equipped items are unavailable - Bold Cardinal Ruby\".    \n \nI came upon this with my rogue - the only orange gem used in the in-built templates is the Agi/Crit so I made custom templates that included Agi/Hit & Agi/Haste. Agi/Haste shows in the comparison pane as superior but will not be used by the optimizer unless you manually mark these gems as available.",

Rawr Cat doesn't come with Expertise gems or expertise/hit gems in its standard table. \r\nWhen i add them into my custom one and try to run the optimizer is seems to think they're not available.\r\nI created a new profile and added them and the error didn't come up. Yet it still didn't use either of the gems even when when i manually change them it is an improvement. ",
