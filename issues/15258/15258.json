In general I would recommend not enabling sequence reconstruction unless you're using advanced solver as you probably won't get anything useful out of it anyway. I'm trying to fix these errors when I find them, but I need to know the exact reproduction steps in order to figure it out. The reconstruction process is very complex and it's not easy to verify correctness.",
