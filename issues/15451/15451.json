    "Description": "The enchant Blackmagic is procced by casts, rogue poisons work for that. As 250 Haste is better than 400 AP for Mutilate rogues, this enchant could be an alternative to Berserk. There's an iCD of 35 Seconds though. Would be great if you added the enchant and thus make it easier to compare it to other enchants.\nÂ \nThanks!",

      "Message": "Here's the deal: Berserking is a chance on melee hit, which works well with a rogue because of your relatively fast weapons, high haste, and all your specials are melee attacks (not spells).  I'm assuming that the reason Black Magic isn't modeled is because the only \"spells\" rogues use are poisons, which means that the uptime of any spell-based proc would be ridiculously low.  So while 250 haste may be better than 400 AP, I would assume 250 haste at a 5% uptime is much worse than 400 AP at a ~20% uptime.",

      "Message": "In the name of SCIENCE!, Gwin and I tested this. Black Magic procs, as expected, for an Enhance shaman, very reliably. Having both weapons enchanted with it is near worthless, as they share the same 35sec internal cooldown, so the 2nd enchant serves only to lower the average time to proc (which is already <2sec). So quite possible to viable for a single weapon, but not both.",
