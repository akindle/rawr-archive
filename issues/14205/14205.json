      "Message": "There is a problem with how Haste is being itemized for the warlock module. Numerous people are reporting issues which all seem to be centered around haste.  Some reason haste on items is causing a negative dps value or dps loss for the item. so we're going to have to wait until haste is corrected, hopefully in next version, so we can plan our gear correctly. Not much we can do other than to wait and see what happens. The coders i assume have normal lives so it may take some time to get issues like this fixed. ",
