    "Description": "In the bear module, the values for the various \"Gladiator's XXXX\" set bonuses do not appear to have been updated with the changes that came in the 3.3 patch (in fact, Gladiator's Sanctuary still seems to be using the old old +35 resil bonus from before it was buffed to +50 resil a while back).  Refreshing the items from the Armory or Wowhead did not update these values.\nÂ \nIn the ProtPaladin/ProtWarrior/TankDK modules, these bonuses do not appear to exist at all. They're not listed in 'Buffs' like the are in the bear module, and equipping multiple pieces of the Furious set to test this did not award any bonus resilience whatsoever.",
