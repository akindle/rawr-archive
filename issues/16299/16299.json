    "Description": "It seems like Rawr isnt taking the full buff's from Talents.\n \nArcane Focus - Increases Chance To Hit and reduces mana cost of Arcane spells by 3%\nPrecision - Reduces the Mana cost and chance to with spells by 3%\n \nI had loaded up Rawr and loaded my Character from Armory. At the same time I disabled all buffs and only added the buffs my mages uses.\n \n- Arcane intelligence\n- Molten Armor\n \nwith a 281 Hit rating Rawr says I was at 11% Hit Rating and 70+ Hit rating undercap. When in game it say I have 281 Hit rating and chance to hit 8%. I dont think Rawr is getting the Hit Buff from Precision in the Frost tree and I know that it covers all class spells.\nMaybe someone can take a look into it ?!",
