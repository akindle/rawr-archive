    "Description": "I posted this in the discussion forum, and I know wildebees is looking into it, but I wanted to post it here as an issue - sorry if it's being redundant, perhaps I should have posted it here in the first place :)\n \nTo clarify (I hope)... when optimizing, for say my mage... the hit-cap can be included as a requirement, and the optimization is being done on the best gear I can have after that cap is reached to keep up an optimal rotation for healing, I need to not only ensure I'm getting the best throughput or not going OOM, but also that when I'm hitting a heal for an emergency situation, outside 'perfect' rotation, that I've reached the soft-cap GCD so I can fire off that big heal to save someone as quickly as possible.\nCurrently when I optimize my gear, I come up short almost an entire second from reaching my 1 sec haste soft-cap, meaning I'm at a disadvantage for a 'save that person who is almost dead' knee-jerk reaction.  \nBasically, I want to be able to treat that haste soft cap as a necessity, because it's not all about a rotation for healing.\nSo I look at it a bit like the hit cap... I want to 'force' that soft-cap of haste (1 sec GCD) to make sure my 'oh shit' heals are fast enough, and then optimize on top of that.  If more haste gets added after that (as you mentioned, particularly in the sustained model), that's great, but I still need to ensure that when things get hairy, I've cut the time off the GCD to save someone as fast as possible.\nDoes that make more sense?\nAnd thank you for looking at this!\nEdit: Also, <a href=\"the'>http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t37578-restoration_itemization/\">the OP of this EJ thread</a> has the Haste rating break-down druids are using to ensure that soft-cap is reached.  Most restos consider that 1 sec GCD a requirement much like the hit-cap for other classes/specs, so of course talents and raid composition come into play as well as listed there (and sorry if I'm giving you tmi, just not sure if you're a resto druid or not =P).\n \n<b>Haste rating</b></font>\n32.79 haste rating increases your haste by 1%. If you have Gift of the Earthmother, you need 19.98% haste to get to a 1 second global cooldown, or 655 haste rating. Wrath of Air totem provides 5% haste and improved Moonkin aura provides 3% haste.
