    "Description": "The problem is in the following calculation:\nfloat cpPerCPGTemp = (chanceHitYellowTemp + chanceCritYellowTemp * (1f + stats.BonusCPOnCrit)) / chanceNonAvoided;\n \nThis should be:\nfloat cpPerCPGTemp = (chanceHitYellowTemp + chanceCritYellowTemp * (1f + stats.BonusCPOnCrit)) * chanceNonAvoided;\n \nWith the current implementation you get less CPs per attack the more Hit/Exp you get.",

      "Message": "No, the  '/chanceNonAvoided' is there intentionally.\r\nIt's done that way because avoids are considered as costing extra energy/GCDs, and then for the purposes of attack results, it removes the avoids from the possible results.\r\n\r\nExample with really big numbers: \r\n\r\nBase: 25% crit chance, 25% hit chance, 50% avoid chance, on an ability that costs 30 energy.\r\nResult: energy cost is 60, costs 2 GCDs, and it crits 50% of the time.\r\n\r\nBase: 25% crity chance, 75% hit chance, 0% avoid chance, on an ability that costs 30 energy.\r\nResult: energy cost is 30, costs 1 GCD, and it crits 25% of the time.",
