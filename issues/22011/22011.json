    "Description": "I have been using rawr on and off for awhile now, I am trying to figure out what my best trinket is. I am trying to decide which 2 of the 3 bone link, creche, or eye of unmaking is better. When I look up bone-link it incorrectly shows the damage that it procs, by a rather large amount. It says 898 dps for the lfr version, in the tooltip it says it only does 10k when it procs. But in the game it shows something much diffrent. In game it shows the trinkets unbuffed proc damage is 19.081k, while in rawr it shows as 10.365k which also incorrectly calculates it's dps contribution.",
