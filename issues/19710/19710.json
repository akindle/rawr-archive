    "Description": "Hi!\n \nHit and expertise being, as far as I know, rather important for a Bear druid, I was wondering why they aren't there anymore.\n \nI tried the optimizer without them, (in case it was already included in the optimization) and I ended up with those two values being under the cap by a large amount. \n \nI haven't read anything about a change in the bear model concerning that issue, so I post it here",

      "Message": "It was a bug that there was a \"Hit Rating\" or \"Expertise Rating\" optimizable stat at all. \r\n\r\nYou should be using Avoided Attacks % and/or Avoided Interrupts % (if that's what you care about) for optimizing in that regard.\r\n\r\nHowever, they are incredibly *un*important to a Bear, and you will be gimping yourself terribly if you do so. The only reason to hitcap as a bear is if you must interrupt, and only then as a last possible resort (should have other raiders do interrupts, not a bear). There is utterly no reason to expertise cap currently.",
