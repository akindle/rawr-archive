    "Description": "Something I've noticed in v2.1.6 is that when using the optimizer, it will end up with 2 Keystone Great-Rings (for example) when they're unique equipped or 2 Defender's Code.  So I went back in versions and noticed this behavior in v2.1.5 as well, but it looks like v2.1.4 does not duplicate the items (which is correct).  Is there an option that I'm overlooking in v2.1.5 and v2.1.6 that lets the optimizer equip 2 copies of a unique item?",

      "Message": "They aren't marked as Unique in Rawr 2.1.6 due to a bug. Right click on them and choose Refresh Data from Armory. Those ones were parsed from wowhead in the default item cache, and our wowhead parser isn't getting uniqueness right at the moment, so they lost their unique tag. We'll get that fixed, but in the mean time, just refresh them from the Armory, and everything'll work fine.",
