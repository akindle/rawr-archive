      "Message": "So what if that is the stats priority. Rawr DOES NOT and NEVER HAS used stats priority numbers. Rawr calculates your dps from each ability based on your equipped stats. Since the models are out of date the suggestions will be completely wrong as they are using old dps formulae.\r\n\r\nSo this issue is meaningless and as such I'll close it. ",
