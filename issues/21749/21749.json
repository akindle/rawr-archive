    "Description": "I have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Version: 4.2.6.0 WPF ==\n \n== Error Message ==\nThere is an error in XML document (45, 10).\nUnable to generate a temporary class (result=1).\nerror CS0016: Could not write to output file 'd:\\Documents and Settings\\Owner\\Local Settings\\Temp\\nqllpokn.dll' -- 'Access is denied.

Error. Character did not load. There was no suggested fix. It's a fresh install so there's not any more information I can give, and I haven't seen anything else while looking in the Issue Tracker - the import stops at \"Parsing Character Data\". I've attempted to load different characters and the result comes out the same each time. It's a fresh install.",

From some googling it seems like one possibility is that your virus scanner is killing the serializer, so I would try temporarily disabling that to see if it helps. Another option would be to try to run Rawr as administrator.",
