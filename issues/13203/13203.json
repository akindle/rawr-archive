    "Description": "I've attached the base XML file for reproducing this. The steps are as follows: my DPS is listed at 6996.78. I switch out Living Flame trinket to Scale of Fates and the DPS is never calculated. It just sits there. Next I change Cord of the White Dawn to Sash of Ancient Power. I wait longer... still no Score or DPS listed. Minutes go by, and I try to switch out Shackles of the Odalisque for anything else, but the drop down list of items doesn't even appear -- the whole program is frozen now. In Task Manager, Rawr looks like this:\nÂ \nCPU Usage: 0%\nMemory Usage: 1,119,116 K (this flucuates slightly, like now it says 1,119,100... and about 30 seconds later, it says 1,119,064)",

      "Message": "There was a problem in one of the constraints in advanced solver that was causing this to happen in the first place. That will be fixed for next release. Regardless I have some suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe advanced solver when in BestBound mode will use memory in proportion with calculation limit. 3000 is too high, what it seems like a freeze is actually your computer running out of memory. What I would suggest for advanced solver on max settings is to use DepthFirst method. There the memory requirements are relatively low regardless of computation limit. Another thing I noticed is you have global and incremental optimizations disabled. I would suggest you enable both, that will improve performance significantly.",
