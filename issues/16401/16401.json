    "Description": "Buffs now contain a list of classes the buffs are valid for.\nBut this list is currently not being (consistently) applied.\n \nHunter, DPSWarrior, EnhanceShaman and EleShaman explicitly use this in their IsBuffsRelevant() override, other models do not.\nAmong others, this causes models to display set bonuses in their Buffs tab that aren't even relevant to the class at all.\n \nFor the moment, it would seem that the IsBuffRelevant() virtual in Rawr.Base/Calculations.cs would need this extra test (even though character parameter in this function always seems to be null).\nAnd for displaying in the buffs panel, an extra test would be needed also (? in BuffSelector.cs : BuildControls() ?)\n \nThe explicit test in the 4 above listed models is then either no longer needed, or other models should be updated to add this test explicitly also.",
