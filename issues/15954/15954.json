      "Message": "1) I saw that the item was defaulted with 1 gem, refreshed from the Armory and it added the second, works.\r\n2) Forced the program to quit (so it wouldn't save the change) then did same thing but from wowhead, works.\r\n3) Marked it as the only item available to the optimizer (rest of char is blank). Hit Optimize, it put the boots on and the socket data stayed as it should have.\r\n\r\nPer that I am unable to reproduce the issue, it stays with 2 gems after having been refreshed.",
