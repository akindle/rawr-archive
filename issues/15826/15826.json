    "Description": "While using the Enhancement module, whenever I change a filter (ie filtering on or off gear from Icc25), and on refreshing anything from WoWHead or Armory, my results as to possible upgrades always vary wildly. For example one moment it'll show Sanctified Frostwitch as the best helm for my set up, yet if refresh, it'll show an ilvl200 helm, or different gem configurations (sometimes even three nightmare tears in the same piece of gear, yet enforce gem req. is clicked). I'm not sure what is causing this problem, seeing as it only occurs in the Enhancement module, and I've not experienced it in the TankDK or Tree Druid modules.",

      "Message": "Not an issue. You have turned off almost all your buffs yet have left \"Use mana calculations\" thus from what you have told Rawr you are going to run out of mana very very very quickly. Thus it is desperately struggling to find ways of getting you that extra mana. \r\n\r\nHint NO MANA = NO DPS.\r\n\r\nSolution is simple actually tell it the buffs you expect to have which tbh you shouldn't have turned off as for Enhancement shaman it makes a MASSIVE difference to our gearing as to whether we are raid buffed or not. Or tell it to ignore mana calculation options (not a great idea).",
