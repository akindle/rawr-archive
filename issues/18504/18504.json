    "Description": "As the title says, when turning on the TS Aura buff, or either of the other 2 equivalent ones, DPS does not go up for the MM hunter. However, for a survival hunter, this does work. Thus, when trying to compare the 2 specs for example, one might come to the conclusion that surv does much higher DPS when in fact the buffs being applied bt RAWR are not the same, surv gets the buff and MM does not.",
