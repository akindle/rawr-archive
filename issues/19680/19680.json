    "Description": "I have had a read trying to find some info on this problem but i cant see it anywhere i could possibly be blind perhaps\nI add my character into Rawr, load it from the armory, but in the main screen it shows that i am under exp cap.\nIs it a coincidence that I am 8 exp short which I get from a talent, is it possible that its not adding the exp I gain from the talent Unleashed Rage?\nBecause it thinks I'm short Expertise its telling me to gem / reforge into expertise to get me up to the cap.",

This is comprised of 503 expertise rating and 8 expertise.  Removing points from Unleashed Rage reduces it to 16/14 Expertise (503 expertise rating and 0/4 expertise).  So Unleashed rage is being factored in to the calculations.\r\n\r\nThe dodge cap is 26 expertise, or 541 rating for shamans, so you are 38 rating under the cap.",

It has randomly generated stats, which is currently not supported in Rawr.\r\n\r\nThis means that there happen to be no stats on your belt (and hence no reforge).  You will have to manually edit them in.",
