    "Description": "I've been following the instructions, and have checked the spelling of my realm (Aman'Thul, as cut-n-pasted from the armory menu) and though I thought it was Oceanic (which doesn't seem to be an option in the dropdowns, I found out it was a German server, so chose EU.... still nothing. I tested whether I could look up any at all and easily loaded a friend's character on Alleria (US realm) but cannot get anything from Aman'Thul. My character's names are Ishkagar/Yzibriel.",
