Make sure you're optimally doing your rotation (Mauling on every single auto attack, Mangling on every single cooldown, FFFing in every cooldown between Mangles, keeping Lacerate rolling, Swiping otherwise).",

      "Message": "This missing enchant is bugging me too.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be true that you're doing something wrong if you're having sustained threat issues *versus equally geared people* but that isn't always a valid assumption.  What if you're gearing up an alt and tanking heroics in blues and a few epics vs. people in ICC gear, or if you're normally a healer but have made a bear offspec with a few feral cast-offs and are trying to tank an ICC-10 with people who have ICC-25 DPS gear.\r\n\r\nHaving this enchant in the model would be nice for bears who are undergeared relative to the DPS they're running with and want to tweak their gear to push their threat a bit higher.",
