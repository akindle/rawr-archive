    "Description": "I'm questioning the value I'm seeing for the enchant \"Precision\" on Boots.  Rawr is rating it the top dps enchant at 99.11 dps followed by haste with 51.04 and so on.  \n \nI read that sometimes right clicking and refreshing an item in WowHead will correct odd items but when I tried that, I got this error message \"[Arg_NullReferenceException]\nArguments: \nDebugging resource strings are unavailable. Often the key and arguments provide sufficient information to diagnose the problem. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=106663&Version=4.0.60310.0&File=mscorlib.dll&Key=Arg_NullReferenceException\"  \nI'm completely illiterate to this language and have no idea what any of that means or what information you may need but I hope this helps.  \n \nPrecision can't really be the top dps enchant for boots....",
