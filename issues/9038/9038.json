    "Description": "This is all with absolutely zero buffs.\n \nI have 155 defense rating which equates to 415 defense or -2.60% to be crit.  This should equate to a 0% chance to be crit however Rawr lists that I have a 0.0166666666% chance to be crit and need either more resilience or 1 more defense rating to be uncrittable.\n \nArmor is almost spot on, 31762 on the game character sheet versus 31760 on Rawr.  \nDodge is off a bit, 38.83% on the game character sheet versus 38.169888% on Rawr.\nAgility and Stamina differ by what I would assume is a rounding issue.\n \nIt seems that the crit miscalculation would be the most pressing to have be correct, unless my 415 defense isn't enough which would probably upset all the theorycrafters.\n \nRokoma of Uther",

      "Message": "Corwin is correct, you do need 1 more def or resil. They really should fix the rounding in the character screen. Armor/Agi/Stam being off slightly is prolly rounding as you say. Dodge is going to be off slightly due to the rounding issues with agi, and also off significantly due to the calculations being for combat against a lvl 73 (-0.6% chance to dodge).\r\n\r\nClosing since there are no issues to fix here.",
