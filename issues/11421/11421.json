      "Message": "The problem is people don't spend a lot of time modeling lower levels, because there is not a whole lot of reason to min/max at lower levels.  Theorycrafting is complex enough at max level without trying to model every level of every skill and all the different specs that people use leveling vs. raiding.  In addition, this is a tool for RAIDING, not solo grinding, where skill rotations are going to be different (depending on class/spec sometimes VERY different).  Also, while leveling up, you tend to go through gear so quickly it doesn't really matter if one piece is .05% better than another, you will probably replace both of them in a level or two.\r\n\r\nJust because the tool assumes level 70 doesn't mean that the results will be wildly inaccurate for lower levels.  For most classes it will provide something that is 'good enough'.  ",
