    "Description": "first, I acknolwage this is not a End-game Raiding item. :) however, it does help when setting up a fresh 80 or a near 80.\nusing 2.3.15 after updateing items both from armoy and Wowhead.\nFrom what I can tell, the 84 crit rating is in the items specs, but the ~1700 per min proc (28 dps) is not.\nI have tried to hand edit the item to add this proc, but likey due to a misunderstanding on my part I am unable.\n \nThis does seem to be class/spec specific because in DPSWarr I can edit the item to get the 1700/min proc to work, but not in Shadow nor Rogue (I didn't test others).\n \nThis can be tested with a Blank character so I am not adding a char file.",
