    "Description": "For Rawr3 I'd like to a see a new method for the Talent Comparison Chart.\n \nPresently, the Talent Chart shows the value of the Next Point (if under cap) or the value of the Last Point (if capped). I would like to see this changed to show a sectional value of the entire Talent (points 1-x) and have it highlight the Current Point(s) Spent.\n \nHere is a Textual Example:\n \nTaste for Blood (2/3)\n[b]1111111111111111-38DPS|2222222222222222-76DPS[/b]|3333333333333333-114DPS\n \n1) I think this would provide a better viewpoint for users when comparing how much power a Talent gives when capped vs 0 as in most cases, that's what users do with most of their talents, max it or drop it.\n2) This would help us devs with debugging, as the 2nd point could be causing some kind of calculational error, or it could be that the talent is giving almost all it's DPS at rank 1 and very little at ranks 2 & 3.\n \nI could also see this as instead of a replacement for the current chart, just let it be an additional one to pick.",
