      "Message": "Also note that the effect is now timed (rather than being consumed by the next attack), and that it is procced by SoulFire itself. As a result, Soul Fire can be spammed after 35%. Though it's likely you are already aware of all that, it was worth making sure :).",

      "Message": "Yes - using it during decimation only.  Clicking the Decimation box doesn't account for the spell in the rotation though. \r\n\r\nThere is a new bug since 3.3 in game (not with this program) - Soul Fire has to be completely cast before timer expires otherwise it does consume a soul shard.  Prior to patch as long as you started cast - no shard was consumed.  Only matters when switching targets.",
