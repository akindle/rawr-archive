    "Description": "My Rawr profile (Lucifel_2_3_8.xml) predicts 2490 DPS with self-buffs only.\nI took a five minute spin on the practice dummy (with badly timed internet lag problems... v_v ) and got around 3800. Pet was on passive, so that wasn't it.\nI'm not really sure what's lacking here, but I notice Glyph of Life Tap shows a value of 0. The 'Relative stat values' (Horridly unreliable, I know...) has no value for crit, int, or hit (when regemmed to be further from hit cap).\nLightweave embroidery is also valued as third best cloak enchant, rather than the first where it should be.",

      "Message": "I have to agree. In the gear and buffs that I am simulating, it is telling me I am going to have a DPS of 3076, went to training dummy w/o buffs, did just over 5000. I followed that by testing same buffs in raid environment and averaged about 6000+.\r\n\r\nI am also experiencing the same issue with it telling me older drops are better. I did take the time to compare them, and some just seem ludicrous. I also notice it doesn't seem to take the Human Spirit Racial + Kings + Glyph of Life Taps total SP to Spirit conversion correctly, often telling me I am losing DPS by not going pure SP rather than gem for socket bonus.",
