    "Description": "the one hand healer mace of \"Trauma\" is not itemized properly (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50028)\n \nit's missing it's 10 yard range AOE 217 and 245 (heroic) healing per target chance on healing proc and effect.\n \nfor some supporting information for the proc rate, it looks like it's a 1-2% chance to proc and no known global cooldown, possibly doesn't have a cooldown due to the proc chance.",

      "Message": "Note, this proc can be added in semi-manually, simply set the proc to a 6 second duration and the stat you want to raise is 'Healed'.  At this time, I would handle it this way.  If you are tank healing, I would set 'Healed' to 217 or 245 respectively.  If you are raid-healing, multiply this by two or 3.  That's the most I'd raise it by.  Again, the proc-rate is so under-whelming, I can't see a valid reason to really work at making specific parts in the model 'just' to make this single item work when it's 10-man counter-part blows it out of the water.  \r\n\r\nSimply put, this proc is not worth the item budget spent on it via the item in-game, go with another weapon unless they up the proc to something realistic.  Any other equal level item I would expect to perform better due to the stat differences.",

The trigger is modeled, just I'm having issues figuring out the proper number of people to proc it off of. Currently on live I have this set to 20 people but realistically 10 is the most it will proc off (7-8 melee 2-3 tanks)",
