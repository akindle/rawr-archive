    "Description": "Been using Rawr for a while now ... love it!  When I opened it today encountered a strange issue using the ProtWar model.  In the comparison section it only shows the gear I own.  I can't find any setting that would cause such a reaction.  If I change the model to DPSWarr it shows all the gear and when checking items other gear is in the database.  I even created a new file and import and it still only shows my gear.  Creating a new file without importing shows no gear, and again switching to DPSWarr model shows all the gear.  Its driving me nutz ... please help.",
