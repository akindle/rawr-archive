    "Description": "I know there is a manual Refine Types of Items listed, but it's not really granular enough right now.  For instance, it's showing me offhand weapons even though I'm a mage and can never dual wield.\nInstead of taking this global setting approach to item viewing, what about just automatically showing the types of items that the current character actually CAN use based on class & spec -- the dialog can be left in place to allow overrides.",
