      "Message": "I had rewritten the addon for self use about 3 or 4 months into MoP, the problem was that RAWR  itself was not updated for it.  The only thing I really did was correct the weapon slots (wands, guns that used to be off hand items for warriors, etc) and a few other things that at this point I honestly cannot recall.  It worked enough to ctrl-c the character and self bag slots in game, but I had not gotten it to successfully scan the bank at that point.  \r\n\r\nThat is beside the point, however.  Sorry for my post the other day I was just extremely frustrated with what was going on.  I am using the RAWR.WPF.exe file, this is what is crashing.  I can't even USE the Silverlight version because as you mentioned, it's not available at the moment on Elitist Jerks, regardless of how old or new (I tried older versions as well as the latest version) your version of Silverlight is.  \r\n\r\nNow I can't even use RAWR.WPF.exe.  I am going to submit a screen shot of the error I am getting, I am going to open it up while I am typing this and attempt to load my alt character, my mage, this seems to be the only character that this crash is happening on.  My Death Knight loads absolutely perfectly, though I don't need to use RAWR with him.  :)  I apologize I did not provide any valuable information yesterday, there were about 10 things going on that were already building up pressure, then I just kind of went off when this kept crashing despite my greatest efforts.  \r\n\r\nCharacter:  Chagoul  Realm:  Exodar US\r\n\r\nAlso, here is a copy/paste of everything that was in that white window of the Windows error just for reference:\r\n\r\nProblem signature:\n  Problem Event Name:\tCLR20r3\n  Problem Signature 01:\trawr.wpf.exe\n  Problem Signature 02:\t5.2.1.0\n  Problem Signature 03:\t51b4a1e9\n  Problem Signature 04:\tRawr.Base.WPF\n  Problem Signature 05:\t5.2.1.0\n  Problem Signature 06:\t51b4a18e\n  Problem Signature 07:\t164c\n  Problem Signature 08:\t17\n  Problem Signature 09:\tSystem.IndexOutOfRangeException\n  OS Version:\t6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1\n  Locale ID:\t1033\n  Additional Information 1:\t51fd\n  Additional Information 2:\t51fd30c58a303a1311847c9bd82d8869\n  Additional Information 3:\t5544\n  Additional Information 4:\t554444cb0c865314a19f3db2de42d71f",
