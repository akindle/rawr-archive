The itemization back then was horrendous compared to the itemization that is in Wrath. As Jothay pointed out, the extra equip itemization from the Frostblade Hatchet is many times better than the itemization on the Ony weapons that are being handed out.",

I know adding support for this would be like... 1 line of code for the ProtWarr module or something.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the same as Bandit's Insignia, which was already modeled in many models quite easily AFAIK. e.g.\r\nstats.AddSpecialEffect(new SpecialEffect(Trigger.PhysicalHit, new Stats() { ShadowDamage = 1666}, 0.0f, 0.0f, -2.0f));\r\n\r\nDon't see any reason not to model it, since if it sucks it would probably be better for us to show that it sucks rather than say \"it probably sucks, but we don't know since we don't model it.\"",

The SpecialEffect processing should do virtually all the work for you, so it should be fairly simple to tack on to the final damage calculations? (At least it would be from what I've seen.)",

What about compared to an ilvl219 Heroic 5-man toc weapon?  It may have more passive stats, but the ilvl245 has a much better damage range/dps.  My guess is, raiders with access to other 245 weapons will skip it (or take it as a temp upgrade); PUGs or people who aren't full-time raiders in the guild will see a noticeable upgrade from their Uld10, Naxx25 or Heroic weapons.",
