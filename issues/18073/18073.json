    "Description": "The algorithm that calculates Moonkin DPS has been changed recently.\n \nRawr 2.3.18 estimates my Moonkin cycle at 8184 DPS.  Rawr 2.3.19 calculates a number of 8853 DPS.\n \nMy character's XML file is included with this post.  I don't know which number to believe as I've seen myself pull 8.9K in ICC-10 trash but only 6K-7K on bosses.",

      "Message": "Short version: releases prior to 2.3.18 vastly undervalued the 2T10 set bonus, as well as having an incorrect formula for calculating Starfall damage.  The new numbers should be considerably higher, and also more accurate if you're doing everything right.  Note that, since Moonkin is not currently capable of modeling casting interruptions/movement, it reflects \"ideal\" conditions, and so the number may be unrealistic on any given boss fight.",
