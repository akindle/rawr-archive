      "Message": "This is NOT an issue. The this is a misunderstanding. \r\n\r\nThe addon does not and CANNOT update to what is equipped. This is for the very very simple reason that it cannot possibly calculate the dps/healing/tanking stuff that Rawr does. So when you change gear you MUST export - re-run Rawr and then import back in in order to update the in game data.\r\n\r\nI did plan to add a warning feature that disables the output or warns or something if you have changed gear. However there are lots of issues around switching specs etc and switching back to same as imported data, where the warning would not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nSolution: When you change gear you MUST re-run Rawr otherwise all the numbers will be potentially very wrong. eg: you change one item now your haste is different and you dropped 252 hit rating. That would make a dramatic difference in how you would reforge, re-enchant or re-gem in order to get back to being hit capped. Therefore the old comparisons are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe addon only ever shows you what is imported vs what is an upgrade, NOT what you have equipped, as the prospect of error is way to high.",
