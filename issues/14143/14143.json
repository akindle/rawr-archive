    "Description": "It would be nice if at least the server string was saved from the previous execution of the problem. \n \nRegistry or XML .config file would be fine (registry preferred to keep the same across versions).\n \nCharacter would be similarly easy to do, list of recently loaded characters would be convenient, but probably asking too much.\n \nSomething like this should make this a relatively easy implementation: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8eyb2ct1.aspx with the LocalFileSettingsProvider. (Actually - I'm stunned there isn't a provider for the registry. I guess they're deprecating its use for that sort of thing in .Net. Odd.)",
