    "Description": "As per the discussion post.\nNew crit mechanics have come to light, that it seems that some people aren't yet aware of.\n \nWe all know that bosses have a 4.8% crit suppression, and 24% of our white attacks are glancing blows.  However, what was previously unknown was if you could stack enough crit or hit to overcome these values.\n \nFor yellow attacks, they do not glance.  The crit suppression can be overcome by extra crit value.  Consider Overpower, an ability with a 50% bonus chance to crit.  If I have 50% crit chance, and I'm hit/expertise capped, my total crit chance is 50% from my stats + 50% from the ability = 100%.  If I'm attacking a boss, that value is decreased by 4.8%, meaning I will crit 95.2% of the time and will hit 4.8% of the time.  If I increased my crit chance to 54.8%, then I will overcome the crit suppression, and wind up having 100% of my overpowers crit.\n \nFor white attacks, the mechanics are different.  Consider when I am hit/expertise capped, and have a 24% chance to glance and 76% chance to crit.  My attack table against a lvl 80 would be 24% glance, 76% crit, and no hits/misses.  Against a boss with crit suppression, I have 24% chance to glance, 71.2% chance to crit, and 4.8% chance to hit.  So far, it's the same as yellows, right?\n \nBut if I increase my crit to 80.8% to try to overcome the crit cap, my white attacks will still be 24% glance / 71.2% crit / 4.8% hit.  Glance cannot be overcome, no matter what.  That 4.8% crit suppression cannot be overcome, no matter what.  So, in this case, 71.2% is my crit cap.\n \nThe full formula for the crit cap is:\n \n100% - 24% glance - 4.8% crit suppression - %dodge - %miss (also factor in parry and block for frontal-attacking like tanks, Auriaya, some Twin Valks strats, etc).",
