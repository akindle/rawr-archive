I just upgraded from 2.3.8 to 2.3.9 and it doesn't work anymore. Also I tried older versions back to 2.3.4, still don't work.\nTo make sure it's not my computers problem, I tried 2 different one (Notebook + remote server). It doesnt work on any of them.\n \nI'm sure I didnt change anything here and I have no firewall running.",

Most likely there is an error but is just not being properly recognized or reported. I've added additional error reporting for 2.3.10, so when that comes out please try again and post the error report again (I'm particularly interested in the last entries (exception and web client exception).",
