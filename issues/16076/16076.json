    "Description": "Is there any difference between melee hit and physical hit on Rawr module? \n \nIf Rawr defines melee hit is only white damage swing, and physical hit is every physical attack (melee and skill) the Bryntroll's proc condition has to be changed. not 15% on melee hit, but 15% on physical hit. \n \nSince the last hidden patch (on jan 8), no one mentioned it so I am doing. :)",
