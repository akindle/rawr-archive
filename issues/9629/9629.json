    "Description": "Neltharion's tear does not have its 16 spell hit listed and Darkmoon Card: Crusader does not have the spell damage component as 80.  These are easy enough to fix but I figure there may be some item parsing errors or something that can be done to fix this permanently.",

      "Message": "Kavan, can you take a look at this? I thought you said DMC:C was working fine. Nelth's is probably another one of those that is defined as an Equip spell instead of just that stat, since it's pre-bc, so you need to do an equip parse for that.",

      "Message": "Hmm, when I refresh the items, Nelth's tear loses its 16 spell hit but DMC:C retains its 80 dmg.  Not sure how that happened but I've only been using the mage module yet DMC:C is behaving properly now even though at one point I had to manually add the 80 dmg.  Since you just mentioned that certain modules filter spell ratings, would it be possible to filter out the warlock specific tiered items from the mage gear listing as well?  Not sure if I should make another post but it seems somewhat on topic here.  ",
