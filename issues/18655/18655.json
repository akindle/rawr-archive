Others slightly off(strength, agility..)\n \nDownloaded from character profiler and Armory. Get same results. Check all equip against each other. \n \nLove this program but concerned about calculations.\n \nAttaching my screen for your comparison",

      "Message": "1) It's called MS Paint... much smaller and easier than Word\r\n2) Procs are averaged, like the Mirror of Truth (AP), Needle Encrusted Scorpion (ArP), Berserking (AP) and any abilities normal to Fury Warriors.\r\n3) Talents affect things and have no idea what your talents are from that image\r\n4) While all that wonderful gear is .. nice.. it works against what I would really need to see here, which is a naked Tauren so I can see the base stats and if *those* are off\r\n5) http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PostingGuidelines\r\n6) How DOES one shit up?",

      "Message": "As per our Posting Guidelines (http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PostingGuidelines&referringTitle=Documentation), Jothay was alluding to a number of reasons why we need the actual character profile (.xml, not .jpg or the like).  We still need that profile if we're to diagnose and potentially fix the issue.\r\n\r\nMy gut is to go with Jothay's early analysis of the situation in that Rawr averages and adds in procs, adds in buffs, and adds in talents, while the Armory and most character profilers only consider your talents (and not even all of them, especially in regards to talents with procs).  Again, we can't say for certain, because we need your character profile (.xml) to be able to help you.",
