    "Description": "Perhaps I'm doing this wrong, but I've selected to not show items of 277 ilevel. If I close my browser, reopen it, and load rawr3 again, all my other filters seem to have stuck, but the 277 one doesn't. If I expand the filter items by level filter again, there is still a check next to the 277 ilevel filter, but I have to uncheck it and check it again to get them removed from the equipment list.",
