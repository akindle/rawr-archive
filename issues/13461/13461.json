But I've seen times that a machine can hang if there's a kernel exception thrown and the system expects a remote debugger to be attached.  Or you can just attach your boot.ini here, and I'll inspect it for ya.",

I know that I could research it more, but in essence, there no user-mode application that I know of can do what you describe.  All things that lock the machine like that are kernel mode. Does it only freeze with Rawr?  Are there other applications that can cause the same behaviour?",

When I open this menu my mouse becomes stuck where it was and no commands work and I have to end up manually rebooting my computer. I have an updated driver for my graphics card and have researched this through Nvidia forums but I have failed to retrieve any helpful information nor a solution. Maybe they are related? When I execute Rawr my computer shows a blue square in the middle of the screen before it completely locks up, so I am left with a blue box in the middle of my desktop with my cursor stuck smack dab in the middle and the computer will not respond to anything but a manual reboot.",
