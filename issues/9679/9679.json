    "Description": "The options to update items take a very long time to complete and the UI seizes up when they run.  How about making a modeless dialog to run the update process with some feedback on expected duration and a cancel button.  This is normally consider a necessary UI element fo tasks that take more than a few seconds and the updates can take 10s of minutes easily.\nÂ \nPlus if it were a modeless dialog, you could continue to use the application while the update runs in the background.  This would be much more user friendly than a very long arbitrary \"hang\" while it updates.",
