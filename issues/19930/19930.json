Included as well is the exported character file [char.xml], Bear model.\n \nedit: I should also mention, I have already tried to reset the item cache as well as all caches. I have also tried to refresh the items in question from wowhead. Neither of these fixed the issue.",

      "Message": "My apologies. Given the direct correlation between ilvl and armour/agi/sta and the fact that secondary stats are comparatively worthless for Bears, I thought it would naturally follow that no agi based ilvl 346 item should be worse than an agi based ilvl 333 item.\r\n\r\nIn having said that, my mistake was a blindingly obvious one to have run into. I've been tinkering with it for some time now and just realized it was due to meta-gem requirements. Both 333 helms which appeared better had yellow sockets which fulfilled the meta-gem requirements, whereas the 346 helms both had blue sockets.",
