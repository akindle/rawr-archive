    "Description": "Character file is attached.  On my shadow priest, Rawr.ShadowPriest values everything as having equal burst dps and sustained dps.  This is clearly not possible and hints at an issue somewhere.  I'm still learning the Rawr source so am yet unable to track it down.\nOf note:  if I begin removing one piece of gear at a time by changing slots to \"Empty\", the burst=sustained eventually stops being equal.  Usually happens about the 4th or 5th item.  You can mark slots empty in any order to see the effect.\nTested with 2.19, 2.20, 2.23, 2.24, all produce the same burst==sustained issue.",
