    "Description": "Hi,\n \nsome of the newer items since patch 3.3 (and maybe other older too) have the wrong faction set. This leads to the fact, that the optimizer won't use it, if you are not from that faction (which is good if the items are marked for the correct faction).\n \nI.E. the item with the item id = 50211 is marked as Alliance, but it should be Neutral. There are at least 3 other items which are marked wrongly.\nAn update of all Items via \"Update Items from WOWhead..\" won't correct this.",
