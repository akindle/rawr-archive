    "Description": "It appears looking in the Bear code that there is handling for periodic crits of Lacerate applying Savage Defense uptime.\n \nfloat lacerateTicksPerSecond = 1f / 3f;\nfloat masteryMultiplier = 1f + (8f + StatConversion.GetMasteryFromRating(stats.MasteryRating)) * 0.04f;\nfloat totalAttacksPerSecond = autoSpecialAttacksPerSecond + lacerateTicksPerSecond;\nfloat averageSDAttackCritChance = 0.5f * (chanceCrit * (autoSpecialAttacksPerSecond / totalAttacksPerSecond) + chanceCritBleed * (lacerateTicksPerSecond / totalAttacksPerSecond)); \n \nWhile this functioned in beta and shortly after live, it does not appear it happens any more. I tested on training dummies last night and applied Lacerate to 3 dummies at a time. After about 30-40 Lacerate peroidic crits, I never saw Savage Defense proc. (Likewise, it did not proc from Thrash periodic crits either.)\n \nThis should probably be adjusted as it would be deflating the value of Crit somewhat by incorrectly inflating SD uptime.",
