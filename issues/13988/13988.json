    "Description": "Hi peeps, \nIm a Moonkin in-game ive just downloaded Rawr and imprted my \"Profile\" from armoury, whilst showing exactly what i have in game Rawr has very different SP total,  mana total, armour total. \nas you know there are 2 forms \"human\" form and \"moonkin\" form, the stats on the main profile are a mix and match of both forms, tbh this was and is very confusing when trying to get the correct balance of gear and compare stats when looking for upgrades, this needs to be the stats OUT of form and needs adjusting. \n \nanother point, i am and enchanter/Jewelcrafter in game so i marked the ones i have available to me, and all the gear that i currently have avail aswell and then ran the optimizer.\nwhen the result came back it was telling me to replace SP gems with Int ones which from a Boomie DPS point of view carry very little weight, and it also told be to change the 81SP staff ench with the +30 Int one??\n \ncan you shed light on this",

      "Message": "Err... What?\r\nA) Stats are in Moonkin form, should be in Moonkin form, and nothing else.\r\nB) It's valuing items with Int heavily because you're running OOM with the settings you chose. Most likely, you're missing mana regen buffs. Goto the Buffs tab, and check whatever buffs you typically get.",

What?\"\r\n\r\nFirst of all let me say im not critising your product, i heard of it and i thought i would have a look, well done on creating such a program im only trying to help \r\n\r\n@ Answer A), the stats its giving are a mix of both forms mate, not 1 or the other for sure, indeed the values for SP, Mana, Armour are in form, but then on the other hand Crit should also be in form and its not! - after checking the option in Buffs for \"Moonkin Form\" only then it changes, personally if your \"model\" is for moonkin form and all other stats are in form then so too should be Crit\r\n\r\n@ Answer B) spot on :D tyvm",

When you use the import function in the latest RAWR to import this toon, at least on my RAWR, for health I get that he has 10,006. This is clearly wrong. When opening up wowarmory online, it reports that he has 5871 unbuffed health, which I manually dropped all buffs on the toon in game and loged out and back in to try to force reload info into wowarmory. When looking at the toon in game, he has 5871 health just as wowarmory reports. This is CLEARLY, for whatever reason, not importing into RAWR properly.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the mana. RARW import clearly, at the same time, says that I have 9591 mana. No, I do not. wowarmory properly reports me as having 7767, game as having 7767 as well. Clearly, something is off in the import with wowarmory and your updates. Also, I checked off nothing in the options, it was a base import without any options changed at all, AND I made sure that my night elf druid was also in HUMAN form for this little experiment with NO buffs on at all.\r\n\r\nSomething isn't adding up with the import, sorry. Any clue as to what and how to fix it?",

Yeah, I feel kinda stupid now, should have looked around the forums a bit more. Oh well, guess I'll have to lvl cap my toons and then play with it. Gonna be a while, have one of just about everything on cairne, alliance side anyways.",
