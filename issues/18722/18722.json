      "Message": "This could lead to moonkins being specced out of their 2T10 bonus?  If they can't read the tooltip on their armor, that's their fault, not mine.  I don't think anyone's going to drop Omen of Clarity because \"Rawr told me to\" and not realize that their 2T10 set bonus requires the presence of the talent.  That being said, it took me longer to type this than it will to fix it.",

It is only of limited use and the user needs to understand the limitations of the optimiser and model.   So many of the talents are not modeled as they do not provide an easy DPS value (run speed) or a talent is assumed as all toons of that spec should have it or they are doing it \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nFar better to just use the in-built specs in Rawr (as long as they are updated) or head to EJ's or some such and look at the recommended builds.     \r\n\r\n     ",
