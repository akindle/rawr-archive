    "Description": "Using 2.3.17 and I believe in 2.3.15, I recieve the error \"You have not selected any of the following: Feet Items\" specifically with Footpads of Impending Death. Loaded from my character's armoury (refreshed data from wowhead and armoury), they and their enchants are equipped and have been Green Diamonded. I have selected/deselected all relevant filters to make sure that filtering is not an issue. This error only occurs with these specific boots, with similar items such as the blacksmithing crafted boots Hellfrozen Bonegrinders the issue does not occur (though I havent tested every available boot, I havent been able to recreate the error with any other boot). I have extremely limited knowledge of rawr, but it seems to me either I've missed a filter setting (though ive been through checking several times so it should be unlikely), or really that it seems simply not to recognise that these boots are flagged to be used, perhaps an ID issue? I have no clue, any input is welcomed.",
