    "Description": "When trying out the new threat-related values in the optimizer for Rawr.Bear, they all ended up causing crashes (if selected as the calculation to optimize) or acting as if the value was always zero (if selected as an additional requirement). After spending some time starting to familiarize myself with the code, I found that they were just missing entries in GetOptimizableCalculationValue. I attached the diff TortoiseSVN generated if it helps. I also changed Missed Attacks to Landed Attacks so that I could optimize for it and get the expected results.",
