    "Description": "I see the filters released in 2.3.17 have been tailored to one individuals idea as to what information is useful to him/her.\n \nThe idea behind the filters and the way I set them up is that the user can choose what he/she is looking for and filter the way they want. Taking out filters just because YOU do not find them useful takes away from everyone else. If there is something you do not want to see simply uncheck it, that is the way the filters work.\n \nIE: Some people actually like to know what drops in VOA, and personally I like the filter for Unknown items so I can view just the unknown items and refresh them.\n \nI do not mind input on how the filters should be handled, but butchering them because you do not understand how they work is just not fun.\nUnderstand that when you remove a sub-filter, you also need to remove the reference for what it is filtering from the main-filter otherwise it just defaults to that filters \"Other\" section and does not get removed at all.\n \nAs always I am open to suggestions and input, but for now, I am working on all the bugs in these new filters \"again\".\n \nJust wish I could actually communicate with the guys/gals that setup the parsing. They are doing a good job, just I would like to exchange some input with them.",
