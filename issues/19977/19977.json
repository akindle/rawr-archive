A mage is the one class I don't have if someone could test this please?\r\n\r\nAlternatively they might not have fixed it yet and the workaround in the addon which checks for client being 4.0.3 will not work when client is 4.0.6.\r\n\r\nCheck - login to Mage type /run Rawr:DebugTalents()\r\n\r\ncheck the output the rogue talent was in tree 1 talent 15 if its not fixed the talent name will be \"not specified\". If this is STILL the case the addon fix is to change the 4.0.3 to 4.0.6 in export.lua line 305.",
