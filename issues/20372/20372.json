I can point out several things that you probably have configured wrong, since they are either definitely wrong, or just out of place for your gear level, but I don't know if that's what you're looking for. What are you asking?",

      "Message": "The words you're saying don't make sense. Crit Rating and Agility are separate stats. Why would agility being lower affect crit rating? I think you're just not communicating clearly or something.\r\n\r\nAs for things that are wrong... \r\nYou have 2/3 Fury Swipes; I assume that's a misclick. \r\nYou are unbuffed. That *greatly* affects calculations, as should be obvious. You should buff yourself as you expect to be buffed in whatever content you want to optimize for. Don't just say \"I don't know what buffs I'll have\" and check nothing. Check what you're likely to have.\r\nThere's a bug currently where the data in the bosshandler is ass-backwards by default, and you have that bad data. A quick look at it should be obvious what's out of whack, but the biggest deal is the boss offensive damage settings; use 1.5spd, 80k dmg, no parry haste, 1 target, for your gear level as a decent starting point, until Jothay fixes his fucked up boss handler data.",
