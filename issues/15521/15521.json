    "Description": "In v2.3.3, the Cat model is quite broken. In Best in Slot gear, a Tauren feral cat was only showing about 52% crit, and 9000dps. I'm guessing with the change to the crit cap mentioned in the release notes, there is a bad decimal error or something.",

      "Message": "First it depends on what your looking to make for \"Best in Slot\" Are you talking about ICC Best in Slot or are you talking about ToC Best in Slot. Because just messing around with ICC only gear and I can easily come up with 10k+ dps with 74% crit and 900+ Arp (I forget off the top of my head what exactly the numbers were since it was me just goofing around but these numbers are close to what I came up with). If you want us to evaluate what you are talking about please attack your file so that we can evaluate the problem. But just saying that the crit cap is broken without anything to back you up is like yelling \"Wolf\" when there is none.",

So the save file I have from 2.3.2 has items that only have names and gem sockets.   This should still be looked at, even if the new wings aren't open.",
