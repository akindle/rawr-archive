    "Description": "My Elemental Shaman uses Scourgelord's Baton (iLevel 251) which drops of Lady DW in ICC10, but in Rawr3 that item is not displayed as an option. After some investigation it appears NO held-in-offhand items are being shown. I went to Refine Types of Items Listed and for offhand both Shield and Misc are checked.  I went into the Item Editor and made the Scourgelord's Baton is listed in the Offhand slot, but type is 'None'. There does not appear to be any type for offhand items other than 'Shield'. So I changed the baton to be a Shield and it then appears in the list. Should there be an Held In Offhand 'type'? Or should checking 'Misc' in the types of items listed show all the offhand items of type 'None'?\nÂ \nThis was in Rawr3 1.0 beta, both in-browser and locally installed version on Mac OS 10.6 on a Macbook Pro.",
