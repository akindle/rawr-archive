    "Description": "Description: The current stats display lists stats of the current state of the character only. If someone were to change an item of their gear, Rawr may suggest changing another or maybe 2 or more items to adjust to the changes of that piece of gear. This may result in several stats changing. Someone may also see that Rawr simply suggests changing a piece of gear to another piece, yet this piece of gear may be very expensive; currently the player only has a quick reference to the big numeric comparison number, while the actual stat changes remain obscured in the background where they go through several conversions and formulations.\nÂ \nSuggestion: Add another column to the stat page that indicates, positive or negative, what all has changed since the character was last saved.",
