    "Description": "The PVP filter is capturing many non-pvp items.  Most of the way into the rule is \"...Leeni||Magatha...\"  note the double bars where there should only be one.  On the other hand, the \"Special Currency\" filter is not capturing many items that are purchased with tokens or justice points. For one concrete example, \"Stormrider's Handwraps\" is being captured by the PVP filter and not being captured by the \"Special Currency\" filter.",

There is one in the Lich King filter too.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the filtering issues is due to lack of source data. Almost none of the Justice Points, etc sources are set.",
