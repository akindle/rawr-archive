    "Description": "I loaded the BiS all items list from Elitist Jerks. once I did that, I started with what I usually do: check all items for sockets with problems (sometimes, when an item has one or 2 sockets, it appears like the socket is not filled. then you have, in the case of the Sindragosa neck, a blue square and right next to it a gem without a colored edge. I don't think this is due to rawr, but more due to an error in the XML file). however, when I do so, I cannot change this for the waist (Astrylian's Sutured Cinch) and the boots (Frostbitten Fur Boots), simply because there don't appear any leather and mail items in the drop-down list. this is either a bug in Rawr, or I have missed the option to allow leather and mail items.\nÂ \nI have attached the XML file, just in case you needed it.",
