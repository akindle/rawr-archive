    "Description": "Rawr.Cat doesn't appear to reduce our critical strike chance based on the level of our opponent. I noticed the difference while I was testing my rotation against a boss target dummy, Per the EJ thread I found (Retesting hit table assumptions - http://elitistjerks.com/f78/t38095-retesting_hit_table_assumptions/), it looks like the reduction is 4.8% crit against a boss.",
