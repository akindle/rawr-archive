    "Description": "When loading Rawr, everything seems out of alignment.\n \nThe first welcome to rawr window has every tab displayed on top of one another, and when you close out of that the item windows overlap the enchants and so on.\n \nCould this be an issue with .net or what actually control the layout of Rawr?\n \nI mis-posted this under discussions and got this reply:\nJothay\nDeveloper\nAug 31 at 7:53 PM\n\t\nCheck your system's Resolution and DPI Settings. The problem is 99% more likely your system than Rawr.\nAnd please, use the Issue Tracker for issues.\n \n \n \nIts not my resolution, I know it is something with my system but I don't know what, that is why I was asking is .net was the main source of the imaging alignment, if it is than I can try just reinstalling .net.\n \nI can post a screenshot of it, when I get back to my laptop, maybe it will make more sense if you can see it.",
