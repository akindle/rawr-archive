    "Description": "Loaded my enhance shaman to optimize gems/enchants, when I went to optimize I got an error saying no legs were available, and then saying that my equipped legs were equipped but not available. As it was loaded from b.net, as well as testing by deselecting and reselecting the pants, and the green diamond was there, it should've been available.",
