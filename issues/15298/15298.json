    "Description": "Tree model is broken in 2.3.1, it seems.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\n \nCreate a new druid tree.\n \nIn the fight options, drag \"Average number of Lifebloom Stacks\" from 0 to 1.\n \nNow select \"Slow build and bloom\" or \"Fast build and bloom\" instead of \"Rolling no bloom\".\n \nScroll the comparison window to the bottom and observe that caster gear is being shown with negative values of \"HealSustained\".  Top scoring gear seems to be feral stuff with caster gems in it...\n \nI don't think this happened in 2.3.0, although the fight detail setup has changed since then so I can't be sure.",
