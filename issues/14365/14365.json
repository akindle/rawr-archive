    "Description": "I deleted the program folder and reinstalled after your notifications.   The new dl shows lvl 258 tier items but won't show lower levels of T9 unless they are equipped when the character downloads from the armory.  I tried disabling with the I filter the range 246+ but this doesn't change things.  Other than this change the filters etc. were left alone.  They arrived all 'active' from T7 on up.",

The \"ALL\" tab has been temporarily removed as a fix in 2.2.21.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, all NULL items will default to the \"Other\" tab, so be sure to check items in the \"Other\" tab to see if the information can be refreshed from the other source (Wowhead/Armory).
