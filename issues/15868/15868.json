    "Description": "My loot master gets frustrated when people take a long time to make a decision.  Rawr does not make it easy to find the score for a specific item, so I would like to be able to exploit Pawn scores so I can know when an item is worth looking up in Rawr.\nÂ \nIf the Relative Stat Values panel had a Pawn-syntax specification I could cut&paste into the game, that would make it easy for me to update the Pawn spec every time I change a piece of gear.",
