    "Description": "I'm a tree.  I run 10 man raids, and our second healer is a shammy. I often benefit from my own Revitalize and the shammy's mana tide totem, but I see no way to tell Rawr to take that into account.  I do not run with a priest, but it's pretty much the same thing so I thought I'd throw Hymn of Hope into the title as well.  Maybe there are other give-your-raid-mana abilities, too, besides replenishment?  \nÂ \nSuggestion for fix:\nAdd those to the buffs for all the classes/specs.",

      "Message": "Interesting tidbit: if you have rejuvenation and wild growth rolling on you, Revitalize will average 12 procs = 12% mana per minute.  That's 1% mp5.  That gives me 240 mp5, which is pretty significant.  If Wild Growth is up 50% on you (which is about right for a 10 man raid & a druid who likes to use it), that drops to .625% mp5, 150 mp5 for me.  Still nothing to scoff at.\r\n\r\nLet see - w/ RJ rolling & 50% WG uptime, that's .5 rage/sec, 1 energy/sec, or 2 runic power/sec.",
