Open the XML file attached to this issue.\n3. Make sure all buffs are disabled (if they aren't already from loading the XML, not sure if that is something that is included)\n4. Note optimal rotation, in my case it is being reported to be SS Ru Ev5 SnD1.\n5. Launch Rawr v3.\n6. Open the XML file attached to this issue in Rawr v3.\n7. Disable all Buffs.\n8. Note optimal rotation (SS Ev4 SnD4).",
