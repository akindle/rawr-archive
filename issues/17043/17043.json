      "Message": "pure laziness of course.. It would be a extremely nice feature.. and while it is rather simple to recreate the talent tree in Rawr, it would be awesome to be able to have it parse a link and automatically fill it in. Especially since Rawr doesn't currently download your second spec when downloading your character from the armory. \r\n\r\nI too would really like to see this feature added to Rawr, it would allow us a quick way to evaluate if xxx 0 day elite dps spec is in fact better for us, then the spec we might currently be checking Rawr against. \r\n\r\nFor instance, you've got: Unholy/Blood, Unholy/Frost, Frost, and Blood.. add in your Tank spec (also multiples), and you've got to manually add ~7 specs which is just time consuming rather then copy/paste, done. (and 7 is low, there's also AOE specs, rather then Single Target to consider..)",
