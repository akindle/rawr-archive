    "Description": "Hello together,\n \nthis evening I saw that a new rawr release came out and I simply loaded my saved character with the new release.\n \nWith the latest release everything seems to be fine. There was a balance between mitigation, suvival and threat stats which seems to be okay for me.\nNow with the new 4.1.02 I'm completely confused cause the addon overrates survival very very much in a way which makes the addon totally unusual for me.\n \nFirst I thought it could depends on the changes with the boss handler or something like that, but after I played around with this tool a little bit I think this assumption has to be wrong.\n \nI have no idea where this problem comes from. There were no changes with the ProtWarr-Model in the last release.",
