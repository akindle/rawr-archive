      "Message": "I think flagging all the gems from the export would put a hefty strain on the optimizer to consider all the gems like that. Most relevant gems are automatically enabled via the Gemming Templates and their assigned gems to the optimizer because of the Enable Gems in Templates to the Optimizer option, which is on by default. Gems outside of that, like wearing the +20 crit gems from WotLK and having those turned on when they should be replaced with the new greens (+30) or blues (+40) from Cata becomes unnecessary. It also gives the user an immediate alert for doing something dumb, like wearing a Dodge gem in Rogue.",

      "Message": "Having lower quality gems marked available is redundant because the optimizer will filter them out. The only potentially problematic thing performance wise is if you'd have pvp gems get marked as a result. That could lower the quality of optimizer results, although I always have pvp marked gems marked available because I'm doing batch optimizations that include pvp sets.\r\n\r\nFor gem to be available it has to either be in gemming template or to be marked available individually. I think the best way would be to give the user an option when importing gear whether to mark gems as available or not.",
