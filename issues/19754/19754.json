    "Description": "For my character file, I am getting two different dps values and scores when loading into the two versions.  Here is a screenshot showing the dps differences for the spells on the main rawr screen:\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/s5ZpJ.jpg\n \nAll stats on the character appear to be the same, and when I hover over the tooltips for each spell, all of those values are even the same between the two versions of the program, it's only the dps value shown that is different.  I am also attaching a copy of my character xml.",
