    "Description": "I am not sure if this is the correct place or way to get this done but here goes.\n \nI am trying to add the item \"Idol of the Crying Moon\" to the item list.  I get it added but there is no Rake trigger to use for cats.  The idol triggers on Lacerate and Rake damage.\n \nMy logic is as follows.  If agility is good for druids, avoidance for bears and crit for cats, then 220 agility all the time is better than 200 agility sometimes.  RAWR supports this when I model my bear and puts Idol of the Crying Moon way out in front as it should be.  When modeling my cat, the item is only placed 3rd in the list under Idol of the Corrupter which has a chance to gront 153 agility.  Surely this is incorrect and could be correctly modeled if the Rake Trigger was added.\n \nI have been using Melee Hit and a few others but it does not give the proper effect as I see it.",
