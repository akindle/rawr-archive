    "Description": "Would it be possible to get items that drop in BC raid content to be pulled when\nthe BC content is filtered out? As it is now, I'm pretty sure they're tied to the \"raids\"\nfilter alone, and while I'd love to go back and get them, at the moment they're\njust getting in the way.",
