    "Description": "I'm using the Cat v2.3.6 model. At 1st it was missing all the ilvl 251 T10. So I went to \"update item cache from Wowhead\". After completing, it then suddenly removed all T10, including ilvl 264/277. I tried updating from Wowarmory, but it made no difference.\nÂ \nEdit: Disregard. I had to reable \"Special Currency\" in the filters drop down. Was disabled after running the cache updater for some reason.",
