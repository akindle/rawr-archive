    "Description": "Hello!\n \nI have been using Rawr for quite some time now... but since the last release I have noticed a discrepancy on my hit cap.\nRawr is showing me at 16.06%, but when I tab back into game with the exact same gear on I am showing at 17.12%.\nAs such, it is making it difficult to prioritize my stats because it keeps telling me to reforge to hit when I am already capped.\n \n \nAny help?\nWas hoping for an answer before Firelands hits!\n \nThanks again!\n \n~L",

      "Message": "Well armory also only shows you at 16% so I'm not sure why this is. I would suggest try looking through your gear one piece at a time, adding hit rating and compare with Rawr if you're able to see where the discrepancy comes from.",
