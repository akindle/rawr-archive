Downloaded the program again and the error is gone in that one, most likely when I updated the item cache as a fresh download fixed it..\r\n\r\nAs to the sort error I mentioned. Best to just describe it in more detail.\r\n1. Open the Program and Select the Form Bear and close program if not in Bear at start\r\n2. Open program again\r\n3. Check the Comparisons window and click sort, there should be (Overall, Alphabetical, Mitigation, Survival and Threat) for Bear form\r\n4. Now click on any armor slow (I chose Head but any will do)\r\n     On the top of the window that appears listing the armor in question is a filter box and another sort drop window that has the same as the Comparisons \r\n        (Overall, Alphabetical, Mitigation, Survival and Threat)\r\n5.
