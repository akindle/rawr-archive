    "Description": "In the attached file hit rating value is negative and for example checking heroic presence on actually lowers my dps. I checked all the buffs one by one and removing rampage / leader of the pack returns hit rating value where it should be. Other buffs had no effect on this.\nÂ \nEdit: This can be closed, duplicate of #16147. My search was not looking for closed tickets.",
