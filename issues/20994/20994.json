      "Message": "This is for the WPF edition.  If you click on the reforging option for the shoulders slot, you should notice that its trying to convert mastery to exp with roughly a 11dps gain when the exp cap has already been exceeded.  That being said this isn't the exact same problem i had yesterday, however i haven't been able to reproduce it as of yet - it kept telling me 33exp was better than 26 by around 400dps",
