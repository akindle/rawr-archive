    "Description": "v2.3.21 crashes consistently when opening at startup a saved character XML file from a local folder that was saved in a prior Rawr 2.x version (2.3.20 here). Try loading two different healing Priest XML profiles at separate times and on each one:\n \n\"Unhandled exception has occurred in your application....The given key was not present in the dictionary....\n \nSee the end of this message for details on invoking \njust-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.\n \n************** Exception Text **************\nSystem.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.\n   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowKeyNotFoundException()\n   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadModel(String displayName)\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character, Boolean unsavedChanges)\n   at Rawr.FormMain.bw_LoadSavedCharacterComplete(Object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\n   at System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.OnRunWorkerCompleted(RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\n   at System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.AsyncOperationCompleted(Object arg)\n \n \nThis error is consistent; it refuses to open this saved character (about 5 different healing profile XML files of it) without crashing with the above error thrown. Also happens opening a saved healing Priest XML profile of a friend from about a month ago. \n \nBut...the error does not happen loading an old XML profile of the same character as Shadow. It has not happened on a couple other older XML profiles on character classes/specs other than healing Priests. It does not happen downloading the healing Priest from the Armory, saving a new XML file after spending several minutes modifying buffs/options, then opening that new profile (which is a gigantic hassle). And it never happened opening old saved XML profiles with v2.3.20.\n \nAfter the first few crashes, I went in and cleared out/deleted the directory Rawr was installed to to get rid of saved files from the prior v2.3.20 used. SpecialCache.bin, BuffCache.xml, ItemFilter.xml & so on were all deleted before the fresh install. Did not make any difference; the above issue still occurred.\n \nOn Windows XP Pro SP3, 32-bit.",

      "Message": "NVM, turns out this was unrelated to the other thing I thought I had fixed. This issue is because .20 and earlier all have a Model Name of \"HolyPriest\" but in .21+ we renamed the model to \"HealPriest\" and there wasn't a check in place to convert to the new name. I have resolve this issue as of commit 52947.\r\n\r\nRawr 2.3.22 will no longer have this problem.",
