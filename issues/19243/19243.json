    "Description": "I load my character a Night Elf Druid - Cat, my professions load and my talents load, but nothing else will.  Current gear will not load, and there are no upgrades that load either just a note saying [Item not found - Automatic Armory] in the gear listing for each gear slot.  For some reason the Install Offline button will not work for me.",
