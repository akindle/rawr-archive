    "Description": "Using a gear set similar to the one that SimulationCraft uses (upgraded with what RAWR says to use) as well as their PTR Frost spec. Currently it appears that the Deep Freeze talent is not activating when the talent is selected or deselected. if you look at my example below using r42758 as a basis, you will see that the dps does not change if the talent is selected or not.\nÂ \nSo far the changes to frost does show a 1k dps increase which is good for the spec as a whole.",
