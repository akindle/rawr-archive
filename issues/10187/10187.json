    "Description": "Currently there's a sort of bug for Elemental Precision in the Frost Tree for mages that it's giving 2% to hit for Frostbolt rather than the listed 1%.\n \nA quick explanation can be found at:\n \nhttp://spicytunas.com/?p=627\n \nAlthough a quick Google search will dig up plenty of hits.\n \nIt's probably technically a bug but it's been live for so long I doubt it will be fixed.\n \nSince I  get 3% from this ghost hit, Rawr thinks I'm under hitcap and is overweighting items with spellhit.\n \nCould you add a checkbox on the Options screen to allow for ghost hit?",

      "Message": "Ghost hit is calculated in Rawr.mage. To see this, in the stats tab, under Spell Info is a list of spells. Hang your mouse over the dps rating for Frostbolt. You'll see the calculated hit rate for this spell, which should be showing 99%. If it's not, then you are indeed under cap.",

Is it included in the gear comparison section as well?\r\n\r\n It seems to be telling me items with more spellhit are better for me than my current gear, which seems odd since my current gear is equal and some times has more spelldmg and other stats than these spellhit items (Anetheron's Noose over Waistwrap of Infinity, Slippers of the Seacaller over Footpads of Madness, a few others.)\r\n\r\nThanks.",
