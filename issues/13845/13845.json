If this is the kind of responses you give people, how much more do you think they will even bother ask?  So in regards to my original question, I am guessing in your opinion, that a polearm will never be a usable weapon for a balanced druid, and that the benefits of a polearm while in the balance tree would not be useful.\r\nThanks Ted",

If, in some extraordinarily unlikely event, one does appear, I will add it to the list of usable items simply enough.  Until then, if you are trying to use a polearm as a moonkin, I'm going to call a spade a spade and say that you need more help than Rawr can give you.",
