    "Description": "The Buff Power Infusion should be optionable as in some raids the disc priest buffs it everytime ready to the best ele/mage/warlock. I didnt find an option for it because i saw the talent wouldnt change anything in the dps for my smitepriest (disc/holy talented as shadowpriestdpser, however it calculates smite as best offensive spell so this should be fine).\nSo i think there should be an Power Infusion Buff option with suboption Asperition as it lowers cooldown (and gives a better relative uptime).",
