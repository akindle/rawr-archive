    "Description": "Warlock Rawr is calculating incorrect stat values due to it valuing Conflagrate way too high - it should be at about 20% or lower damage done, instead it is around 70%, thus calculating its average hit at 24k+ (instead of 7k+ it should be), and average crit over 50k (instead of 13k+ it should be). Rawr is assigning too much value in Crit rating due to this. iI do not know the math used in Rawr, so I can't say what's causing this. Perhaps the spell's cooldown has been left out it or maybe it has wrong coefficients. Bottom line is, Rawr does not work for Destruction due to this, and any result it gives can't be trusted.",
