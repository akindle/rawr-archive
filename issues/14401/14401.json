    "Description": "It seems that the filters for item shown, found under Options > Misc, are behaving oddly.  With Mail and Leather options being shown (which, in my honest opinion, they should be by default, like they used to be *hinthintnudgenudge*), toggling on and off the \"Hide Spell Gear\"(HSG) input does not act as it should.  Expected behavior: Int should be ignored as a \"caster stat\", and items with Int as the sole caster-specific stat should still show regardless of HSG state.\nÂ \nExample of erroneous behavior, as shown in the character file attached:  When toggling HSG, the Treads of the Icewalker are not hidden - correct.  When toggling HSG, the Legguards of the Lurking Threat are hidden - incorrect.  this persist for both items, despite reloading item stats from both databases and testing each round of fresh info.",
