      "Message": "Yeah, i've been meaning to post this for a while.    It is to do with all items haveing \"The Bastion of Twilight\" and the filters having \"Bastion of Twilight\".   This results in the heroic filter looking for \"Heroic Bastion of Twilight\" and not finding it because the item has \"Heroic The Bastion of Twilight\"    \r\n\r\nAdding a \"The\" to the rules for normal & heroic sub-categories of Bastion of Twilight fixes the filter.\r\n\r\n",
