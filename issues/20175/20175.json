    "Description": "I was curious what the new tree hit calculation was going to return so I set a breakpoint just after the assignment to meleeHit.  To my surprise, it was returning a negative hit percentage.  I've tracked this down to:\n  StatConversion.GetSpellMiss(bossLevel - playerLevel, false)\nGetSpellMiss wants it's first argument to be \"Attacker Level - Defender Level\"\nÂ \nAs an aside, I'm curious -- is there new information that indicates that the tree hit takes into account the benefit from balance of power?",
