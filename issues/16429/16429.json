    "Description": "Running two computers with Win7, one computer with Windows XP. All three computers are having severe problems with DKDPS RAWR. I back tracked to Rawr 2.3.5 and that version I have no trouble with. Everything runs smoothly and quickly. However once I move up to Rawr 2.3.6, everything runs slowly ... and when I say slowly I mean 45 minutes to an hour and a half optimizations. I am not running any beta updates for Win7, however I am completely up to date on all three computers. \nÂ \nIf there is any additional feed back you need, I'd be happy to post it. I've been waiting for a fix since 2.3.7 but it seems to have gone without question which makes me think I might be one of only a few.",
