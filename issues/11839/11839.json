    "Description": "It seems there is some incompatibility between Rawr 2.1.3 and Character Profiler. For some reason it is ignoring some of my characters. I tried to force it by deleting the CharacterProfiler.lua file and recreating it with information from only one of the characters that Rawr was ignoring/missing and then I got the following error:\n \nError reading saved variable file: InvalidArgument=Value of  '0' is not valid for 'SelectedIndex'.\nParameter name: SelectedIndex\n \nI'm using rpgo-CharacterProfiler released on 2008/11/01\nI had to import the information using Rawr 2.1.2 and then save it as a Rawr file and open it with 2.1.3",
