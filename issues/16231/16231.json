    "Description": "When optimizing a death knight for talents, it does not correctly verify/mark that the appropriate strike talent has been purchased.  Most noticeable for DK Tank build and optimizing for talents.  No strike was selected, but the rotation and glyph suggestions showed that both Frost strike and Scourge strike were available, when neither were.",

However, the model for a given strike should require having that talent before actually valuing that particular strike.  \r\nI agree that the current \"Talent Optimizer\" is not ideal in the TankDK model.  This won't be ready until I get the ability re-work done that's been in progress for a while.",
