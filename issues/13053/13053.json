    "Description": "Rawr converting IconPath values to lowercase to show item icons. \nSo users who are using Turkish regional settings have problem about download icons and program runs too slow for this reason.\n \nExample : \nhere is an icon path for an item :<IconPath>INV_Shirt_Blue_01</IconPath>\nso IconPath is : INV_Shirt_Blue_01\n \nrawr converts this value to lowercase: \nnormally lowercase convert gives \"inv_shirt_blue_01\"\nbut with Turkish Regional Settings lowercase convert gives : \"ınv_shirt_blue_01\"\nso there is no icon to download with \"ınv_shirt_blue_01\" as path.\n \nSolution : \nfind & replace \"INV_\" to \"inv_\" at ItemCache.xml then deploy project, so all people will not have problem about lowercase.",
