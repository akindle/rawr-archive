    "Description": "Why does gear under rawr character and optimser upgrade list show different scores?  I am trying to work out what is best to spend my valor points on and I am getting different results on the optimiser than the character import from wow.  I am not a teccie sort of person, doing my best with it but I don't understand why this would be.  I attach an example for head item, as you can see the character screen shows the only upgrade as higher level Timelord's Hood, but the optimiser suggests that Hood of Hidden Flesh is an upgrade.  I don't understand, please help, I have VPs awaiting spending! : )",
