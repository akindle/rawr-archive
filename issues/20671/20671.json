    "Description": "With Rawr 4.1.03 I received multiple errors when trying to load from Battle.net. There was no suggested fix.\nI installed 4.1.04 today and can now import from Battle.net but can't \"save as\" the character to file. This is the info I get:\nCannot access file because file name is null or empty.\nNo Suggested Fix\n   at Microsoft.Win32.SaveFileDialog.OpenFile()\n   at Rawr.UI.MainPage.SaveAsCharacter(Object sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.EventRoute.InvokeHandlersImpl(Object source, RoutedEventArgs args, Boolean reRaised)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseEventImpl(DependencyObject sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem.InvokeClickAfterRender(Object arg)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.InternalRealCall(Delegate callback, Object args, Int32 numArgs)\n   at MS.Internal.Threading.ExceptionFilterHelper.TryCatchWhen(Object source, Delegate method, Object args, Int32 numArgs, Delegate catchHandler)\nÂ \nThis is for a hunter and I realize they are inoperable, but I would like to save my character info for when it is operable.\nThanks for your help.",
