    "Description": "I got this axe today in Ony25, Raging Deathbringer, http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49500 and when I go to Edit Items it shows up there but when I go to main hand and try to equip it it won't show up there. Armory is refusing to refresh my character, so I can't have it pull my gear from armory. Any suggestions on how to fix it?\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\nLaunch Rawr\nLook at Main hand and Off Hand\nObserve that there is no Raging Deathrbinger in either.\n \nAdditional Information:\nRawr v2.2.27\nWindows 7",

Testing it out in raids, the Shadowbolt damage dows nearly 2% of my overall damage, however, that's just icing on the cake. Being that melee and windfury make up the majority of my damage, having a weapon that increases max damage by 85 means a lot harder hits with Windfury and melee.",

      "Message": "Also as part of that conversation, we went over how that '2% of my damage' pales in comparison to a real weapon with actual stats. The only reason its an upgrade for you is because your weapons are a few tiers below it, so the raw damage is higher. The only class that can beef the power of those hits enough to make it even close to comparable is DK's (I think unholy only, but the others still get more benefit than an Enhance).",
