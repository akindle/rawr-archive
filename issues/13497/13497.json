    "Description": "The placement of the file ItemChache.xml is incorrect. A program must never try to write in its installation directory on all newer Windows Operating Systems (Vista, Win7). If a program is installed in the Program Files directory (where it belongs to! ) it needs to be launched with admin rights if it needs to write in its directory. But this is not necessary: Please save those files to %APPDATA%, reachable with the API function http://search.msdn.microsoft.com/search/results.aspx?View=msdn&st=b&qu=SHGETSPECIALFOLDERLOCATION and the CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA  = $001C",

      "Message": "So while I have all my computer's programs in one folder which happens to be the *standard* folder for programs, I have to move this *one* program to else where to make it work correctly? I think, that's fairly inconvenient and not very user friendly. It's of course not a major problem, but imho it should be given at least a low priority, since many people use Windows Vista and soon Win7, and since Vista, this way of doing it has been defined as standard for windows programs.\r\nI don't have any experience with C#, but maybe this snipped in pascal is helpful: http://codeviewer.org/view/code:8ac [note: I have only translated the comments and added a few lines; the code itself is found here: http://www.delphi-library.de/viewtopic.php?t=9428 ]\r\n\r\n(Also: Wikipedia defines \"installation\" like this: \"Installation (or setup) of a program (including drivers, plugins, etc.) is the act of putting the program onto a computer system so that it can be executed.\" but that just as a side note ;) )",

I understand now, that I completely wasted my time trying (and a lot of it) to talk in a civilized manner with you.\r\nSeriously now, do you treat *all* people that spend time to try and help you, like that? Geez, some people, trolling your *own* comment section... I've never said it's important I just considered it an issue worth mentioning; you know, *some* people want their programs to be perfect and not just work in their own, little testing environment, apparently you're more the \"it compiles! we can sell it!\" kind of programmer. If you can't cope with criticism, just don't look into the issues section.\r\nIf your last comment's main point (besides insulting me for daring to criticise your holyness) was about my snippet being in pascal - just because you can't just copy&paste it (and apparently not even read it) doesn't mean it's completely useless, you know, that's what you have that weird thing over your sholders carrying your hair for.\r\nAs for the rest of the developement team: thank's for looking at the issue, just think about it for a moment. I don't tell you how to do your job, I'm just telling you about a problem I had with your program. I hope my effords weren't completely in vain.\r\n",

      "Message": "Not being a technology wiz, but if rawr was changed so that it saves the itemchache.xml and the other files into %APPDATA%, what happens to those people who don't unzip rawr into the Program Files directory (i.e. put it on a USB stick)?\r\nOn another note, since to \"install\" rawr, you are merely unzipping it to a specified folder, how do you get the .xmls that come with main files into the %APPDATA% folder without an actual installer or being manually moved?\r\nIn the end, I think that it is actually alot of work that doesn't really do anything for the functionality of Rawr.",

Actually installing Rawr would introduce a huge host of other problems, which are entirely not worth it.",

The installation part was just a side note, I even enclosed it in brackets and put a smilie at the end to point out that it's of no significance at all.\r\nThe pascal snippet: I just thought giving you some code is better than giving you no code at all.\r\nMy point is: I spent time and efford in reporting what I consider a bug, I even tried to give you a useful solution, and what do I get? Sarkasm in a way that's even insulting. No offence, but that got me *really* angry. So, sorry for my part of the insulting.\r\nBack to topic: Yeah, portability is an issue in this. Maybe you could give the user the choice to use the program portable or not. Maybe you could just prevent the program from crashing when it can't write there, by trying, and if it doesn't work, ask the user where to save the files instead (or ask them if they want to save in %APPDATA%).\r\nOh right, I forgot to mention: When I closed the program, it crashed, displaying this message: \"Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.\" But if I click continue, nothing happens, the program doesn't \"continue to close\" but \"continue to work\". If I click Quit, nothing happens either, so I can only close it with the task manager. If you could just fix that, I'd be totally happy ;)",

      "Message": "Indeed, everything you describe is an indication of Rawr being unable to write to its own directory. While it may sound nice, in theory, for all programs to be in Program Files, the reality of it is that Program Files is reserved for only programs which are installed, and should only be touched by installers. By manually copying Rawr into Program Files, you break that level of separation. That's not something you did wrong (or rather, should have known is wrong); Windows isn't clear on that distinction.\r\n\r\nI think the actual change that makes sense is just to have better error reporting/handling of this situation.",
