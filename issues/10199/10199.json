    "Description": "I've noticed this problem since I started using Rawr with b13:\n \nWhen on my work computer, any Rawr dialogs (item editing, optimizer, etc.) get cropped off at the bottom of the dialog window, obscuring the buttons (see attached pic). This doesn't happen on my home computer.\n \nThe specs on my work computer are as follows:\n \n• Dell Precision 390\n• Intel Core2 Duo E6400\n• 2GB RAM\n• ATI FireGL V3400 running Dual 20\" Dell LCDs @ 1600x1200 (each)\n• Windows XP Profession w/SP 2",

You can fix that by going to Display Options > Advanced > DPI, and setting it back to normal.\r\n\r\nI've made some changes to try to improve how it looks for users on high DPIs, but it's still annoying and imperfect.
