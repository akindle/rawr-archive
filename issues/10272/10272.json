      "Message": "For me at least it occurs for literally every item with a damage socket bonus. If I run the refresh item data command the socket bonus disappears from literally every item unless the bonus is something other than +2/+4/+5 Spell Damage which for the DPS caster items obviously is the exception rather than the rule. Hatefury Mantle for instance works fine because the bonus is Spell Crit rating, and Cowl of the Tempest since it's Stamina. I've refreshed item data for individual items as well and they all lose the socket bonus if it's a Spell Damage one.",
