    "Description": "4.2.1 is still experiencing the exact problem described in this work item:\n \nhttp://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/21055\n \nPerhaps Druid gearing was debugged but Prot warrior gearing has not.  After slotting about half the gear slots for prot, the program slows and locks.  This happens in both WPF and online versions, every time.  Saving and loading data has no effect - regardless of the slot after the 6th or 7th piece of gear is slotted the issue begins.  Changing gems/enchants/reforge seems to have no effect on when the issue occurs, happening consistently on the slotting.",
