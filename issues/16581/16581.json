    "Description": "REQUEST: a way to make users abundantly aware when they are using a model that is know to be incomplete, glaring bug(s), and/or completely out of date.\n \nSUGGESTION: a popup window with warning text for such models right when it's loaded, and every time it's loaded.  It could be a method in some Rawr.Base class that can be overridden in any model to return the string to show in the popup (or not show the popup at all if not overridden).\n \nADDITIONAL INFO: I have had guildies download Rawr and spend a bunch of time setting things up, then complain to me about it not agreeing with info they were getting from any other source.  Of course, they were using the Hunter or similar model that nobody claimed was even close to accurate at the time.  I suspect this happens to others, as well, and could be easily avoided with a simple addition like a popup warning.",
