    "Description": "According to all I have read, optimization should follow the mastery>dodge>parry set up. For some reason when I optimize my DK for overall rating, it wants me to reforge from mastery to parry and very little dodge. I end up with 11% dodge and 26% parry. When I reforge for mitigation rating, it tells me to gem and reforge for all dodge, and almost none to mastery. This time I end up with 15.91% Dodge, 24.78% Parry and 15.25% Mastery. Is there something wrong with the program, or do I simply not understand what I am doing?",

      "Message": "- TankDK significantly relies on the Boss selected.  Without a boss selected, expect your values to be inaccurate.\r\n- Avoidance and Mastery are counter-indicative.  More Avoidance means mastery will be worth less.  This is mitigated by choosing the right boss.  \r\n- Dodge and parry would be equal if we only looked at damage mitigation.  However, Parry also has a \"Burst\" value component that makes it more valuable over time due to things like on-use CDs.  If you set \"burst\" weighting to 0, you would notice that mastery would be worthless, but Dodge and Parry would be more along the lines of what you expect.  \r\n",
