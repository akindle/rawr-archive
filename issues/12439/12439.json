    "Description": "While trying out various arcane specs and gear setups, I noticed Shifting Naaru Sliver is better dps for certain builds than the Forge Ember I was using for fire. So I equipped it and Rawr suddenly bloated to huge memory size slowly bringing my laptop to a standstill. I'm thinking that with all various combinations of arcane rotations that adding another activated cooldown is just offering Rawr far too many possibilities.\nÂ \nFor the record, I have a limit of 100 iterations, 'depth first' selected, 'segmented cooldowns' and 'integral mana consumables' set for display but not for comparison.",

      "Message": "Actually I'm starting to believe now that it's because I had too much other stuff running (Virtual PC, SQL Server and manager, etc). Rawr was probably only able to allocate 800-900 megs freely and the slowdown probably happened when it went above that and windows started trying to reallocate memory from the other apps.\r\n\r\nYou can close this ticket, I'll make a new if I see something more concrete.",
