    "Description": "Since about 2.3.8, adjusting anything on a death knight operates very slowly. For example, using the optimizer has even caused the system to just crash. The average time switching between menus is 30-40s. It does not do this for priest or rogue loads.\n \nI am using XP, and have been using Rawr for quite some time now.\n \nIs this a known issue, and is there anything that can be or is being done about it?",
