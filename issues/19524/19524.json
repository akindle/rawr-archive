    "Description": "I would like the ability to have Rawr4 export the upgrade list to a CSV file like the older standalone Rawr used to do. This way, I can load the upgrade list into Excel and filter based on the Dungeon/Raid/Boss/Slot  and know what drops are upgrades for me or not and how much of an upgrade they are before deciding how badly I want it.\nÂ \nSuggestion: In the Upgrade Comparison window there is a Save button. Add an \"Export\" button with an option for CSV.",

      "Message": "We may add this feature however this feature is planned to be added to the in game addon. The idea will be to import the direct upgrades list and you can view it in game. I may even be able to add a pop up warning to say. Boss XXX just dropped YYY which is in your upgrade list. This depends on how looting works. This might require that you loot the body which would be annoying for Master Looter situations. \r\n\r\nWhat might work easier would be a pop up warning to say YYYY loot linked in chat, shown in need/greed rolls etc. Can users identify how they normally see loot from bosses in their raid. Does the RL link it in chat? Do you have to use an addon and he links it through that? Is it standard need/greed window? Do you have to click the body to see the loot? How do YOU see what a raid boss has dropped?",

      "Message": "That seems a bit complicated Levva. And as you wrote yourself, it depends on the loot distribution method, which is different for each guild.\r\n\r\nSince addons like Deadly Boss Mods can detect the name of the encounter and if you kill ot or not, I think it would be easier to just put a warning at the end of an encounter if the loot table contains an item that is also in your upgrade list (whether the item actually dropped or not). Seems easier to implement too if you can re use the code in DBM for example :)",

    {
      "Message": "re-using the code in DBM means needing to update when it updates or adding a dependancy. Neither is good.\r\n\r\nWhat I plan on is seeing items linked or seeing a loot window open. I won't bother with anything else. However first of all I'll need to actually get the direct upgrade items imported.",

      "Message": "An ingame tool would be awesome.  But I would still like a CSV export since it gives much more flexibility to sort and filter the data in Excel and plan stuff out.   I'm hoping it would be much easier to implement that an in-game upgrade and thus we might get that feature faster. :-)",
