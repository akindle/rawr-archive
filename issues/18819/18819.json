    "Description": "V2.3.23 is missing adding in the expertise contributed by Veteran of the Third War talent (Blood).  2.3.22 is calculating fine, but expertise is off by 6 in .23. Verified that Strength & Stamina change with addition of talent points in Veteran, but Expertise does not change at all. Optimization is therefore not working correctly as it thinks I'm not Expertise capped.",

Working my way back down the Blood talent tree until I get to V3W, it makes no impact on the Expertise value (remains @ 24.89).",
