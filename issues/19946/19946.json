    "Description": "I have the Dreamless Belt with the Ebonsteel Belt Buckle on it. The gems I have socketed are Veiled Demonseye and Rigid Ocean Sapphire. The regular Rawr display (both offline--b4.0.19--and online) properly shows both the built-in gem socket and the belt buckle socket. However, when I run Optimize either offline or online, it only displays one socket and suggests Brilliant Inferno Ruby, and if I accept the changes, the display shows both sockets containing the ruby.\n \nOne time when I did the optimization, it appeared to suggest Veiled Demonseye and when I accepted the changes, it showed Veiled Demonseye and Brilliant Inferno Ruby. So I believe that it is actually recommending two gems but only displaying the built-in one.\n \nI have attached a screenshot of the offline optimization results.",
