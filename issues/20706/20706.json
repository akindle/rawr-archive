    "Description": "I am not able to save as, I can only open old files. Such issues appeared only on the previous version and this.\n \nThis version does not give the error window that often but it appears silently ignoring operations of that nature.\n \nThe web client appeared to have better behavior [actually, fully correct behavior], at least recently.\n \nedit: I wonder if the developer responsible operates mainly on the web client because I noticed no problem there at least on previous version.\n \nedit: Windows 7 64\n \nedit: It appears to be able to save (not save as) on an old file, but I can't vouch on stability.\n \nedit: It 'save's on an empty character setup after it automatically asks for a new file name. Explicitly trying to 'save as' on an empty character it gives: \n \n'Cannot access file because file name is null or empty.'\n \n   at Microsoft.Win32.SaveFileDialog.OpenFile()\n   at Rawr.UI.MainPage.SaveAsCharacter(Object sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.EventRoute.InvokeHandlersImpl(Object source, RoutedEventArgs args, Boolean reRaised)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseEventImpl(DependencyObject sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem.InvokeClickAfterRender(Object arg)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.InternalRealCall(Delegate callback, Object args, Int32 numArgs)\n   at MS.Internal.Threading.ExceptionFilterHelper.TryCatchWhen(Object source, Delegate method, Object args, Int32 numArgs, Delegate catchHandler)\n \nBut I do not know if it's related or an old issue with empty characters.",
