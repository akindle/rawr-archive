    "Description": "For quite a while the DPSDK Model hasn't been able to save custom rotations (it seemed). Now I had a look into the source file and found out why it didn't and while I was there, I allowed myself to fix it. The Problem was, that he handled the Data Entry with KeyPress events. I replaced all those with KeyUp events. Also I unlocked the other 3 Rotations in case people want to adjust them on the fly.",
