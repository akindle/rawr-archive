    "Description": "As the description entails, the warlock module seems very incomplete with pet DPS not showing up at all with any of them selected. In addition to this, Rawr doesn't seem to recognize +81 Spellpower to 2H as a valid enchant.\n \nEdit: Just saw the post about 2.3.9 for the proposed Warlock pet fix, but the enchant still remains.\n \nFurthermore regarding the DKDPS module, it seems to take entirely way too long to do anything from selecting buffs to optimizing where other modules (at least from what I've used like the Ret and ProtPal module) work at the speed that it should.\n \nAlso, is there any issues with the Ret module at all or is it basically 100% working as intended with gear choices?",
