    "Description": "When I optimize my gear, Optimizer doesn't get the best enchant for my weapon and the enchant that brings always up is the one i had when the character was loaded.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n01. Launch Rawr\n02. Load a Mage equiped with a Staff, which is enchanted with \"Greater Spellpower (Staff).\"\n03. Check in the item list a better combination of a dagger/sword and an off-hand (like Rigormortis and Scourgelord's Baton)\n04. Tools > Optimize\n05. Thoroughness to full (I don't know if it matters)\n06. Click Optimize\n07. Now as you can see the dagger/sword is still enchanted with \"Greater Spellpower (Staff)\", even if it doesn't gain anything from that.\n \nSome Additional Steps:\n08. Click Load Optimized Gear Setup\n09. Set manually the enchant of the dagger/sword to \"Mighty Spellpower\" (or other enchant)\n10. Tools > Optimize\n11. Click Optimize\n12. As you can see the Optimizer chooses again \"Greater Spellpower (Staff)\", which gives zero spellpower to a dagger or a sword, and the resulted score is lower to the previous one.\n \nAdditional Information:\nRawr 2.3.8 and 2.3.9\nWindows 7\n \nPS: The additional steps' purpose is only to ensure that Rawr is choosing an inferior enchantment.\n     At the attached file you can see the end results of those twelve steps on my character.\n     Also check the score before and after in the picture.",
