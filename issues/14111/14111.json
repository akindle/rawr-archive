    "Description": "In the attached saved character, I am wearing the t8.5 elemental chest and no other set pieces, but it is recommending that I choose the t8.5 resto gloves over the t8.5 ele gloves (which would give me a set bonus). Besides sockets and their bonuses, these items have the same stats. When I equip the ele gloves, Rawr says I have the set bonus, but I would do less DPS which makes no sense.",
