    "Description": "This is from the thread I started in the other forum, and here I supply the requested xml file.\n \n\"Hi there,\n \nafter loading my character from armory, I cant seem to change the set bonuses from 2 piece to 4 piece in the buffs pane. Its correctly recognizes I have 2 x 2 piece bonuses, but wont allow me to change anything. The whole box is greyed out, which precludes me from evaluating benefits of one set versus another (2 piece versus 4 piece etc). Just not implemented yet?\"\n \n\"....sorry if I wasnt clear enough first time. I did try equipping 4 pieces, and it doesnt recognize them. I'm assuming you can just equip from the gear list, and see what the ramifications are on the stats. But despite swapping out 2 pieces of Kirin Tor for 2 pieces of Khadgar's (resulting in 4 pieces of Khadgar's), it still shows me as having 2 pieces of Kirin Tor and 2 of Khadgar's (with both being greyed out). I'm assuming this is the correct way of doing this?\"",
