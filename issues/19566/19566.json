      "Message": "Yes this is not really an addon issue as such in that the addon simply passes in a list of item ids so its doing its job. Most of the reason is not having green items in the item cache. However, as you know, the size of the cache supplied would be enormous if we included all possible items. It is really the import option that might be missing a call to force a cache refresh if items aren't found. I had thought that the cache was refreshed on load similar to how a battle.net load works.\r\n\r\nI didn't actually have anything to do with the load code so I'll bump this over to Jothay to have a look at as he did that bit.",
