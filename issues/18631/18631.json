    "Description": "Sorry if this gets long winded but is it possible to add Fractured Cardinal Rubies to the default gemming template? Here's the issue i run across...\nÂ \nThere's a point at which Arp becomes the best gem for DKDPS but without it added to the Default gemming template it causes gear to be sorted strangely in the Comparisons window. For instance with the file i have attached it shows my current headpiece (264 Sanctified) as best in slot with Arp gemmed and the 277 piece as second best in slot with a STR/Haste and Nightmare Tear equipped. This is a little misleading so I added a custom gemming and it had no effect on the comparison page. i.e., the 277 piece is still ranked below the 266. So i disable the default gemming templates from being used and go with only selected gems chosen within the Comparisons window under gems. This causes almost every piece of gear to disappear from the comparisons window except the pieces you currently have equipped. Not a big deal, just misleading and annoying for me.",
