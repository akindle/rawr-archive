The spreadsheet seems to recommend all AP gems with some haste while rawr seems to recommend all agility gems with some crit (and weirdly a agi/stam gem for chest).\nÂ \nI haven't modeled some of my gear in the spreadsheet, I have some heroic level gear that isn't included as a choice.",

That Rawr does it is not weird because you need a blue gem to activate your meta gem which is not activated in your spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that the talent build is completely different between the 2. The Rawr file has a PvP build while the spreadsheet has a PvE build.",
