Check your socket bonuses for all your items and see if any of them have \"Socket Bonus : None\" ie: NOT that you've chosen gems that don't match, there is nothing wrong with that, but have your items simply got no socket bonus??\r\n\r\nI suspect your Belt of Dragons hasn't got its +12 AP or you T9 Head or T9 chest hasn't got its +16 AP. ie: something is missing the socket bonuses. This then means the item is being undervalued and missing those bonuses when exported.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a DATA issue and not a PROGRAM issue. ie: nothing we can do to fix it. You simply need to right click - edit the item and add in the socket bonus. You can do this per item then export the result to give the right figures in EnhSim.",
