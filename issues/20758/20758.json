    "Description": "I load my mage in from armory and the data that is loaded into rawr appears to be accurate. My hit rating total was around 3.5% hit lower on rawr than the actual value (on armory). I noticed under the statistics for my mage the spell hit category had a large gap between +2 and +3 target level. An equal level of 85 had me over hit cap by a good bit, as did +1 and +2. Level 88 raid boss (+3) had a much larger numeric value gap than any other level brackets did. I was under hit cap by nearly 4%...when the target at level 87 showed me over hit cap by a few hundred rating. Very odd, but maybe I'm totally missing something. Been using rawr for years now, first time I've had such an issue.",
