    "Description": "I'm sorry if the 3.2 patch changed all this with the dodge and parry rating change, but my Rawr is telling me to almost gem ALL my gear with dodge rating. I know avoidance is good and all, but with DR coming into play it'd be a loss. I optimize with full Thoroughness, and it still does it and the Optimized value is lower. My XML file is attached.",

I do see a couple of gems being moved to dodge and defense (or some split version of the gem).\r\n\r\nLooking more closely, it appears that the optimizer is working gems SOLELY off of the Gemming templates, not by any form of actually selecting gems that are available. This could and probably is part of your problem.\r\n\r\nDo you have custom gemming templates set and/or do you have any additional template selections active beyond \"Rare\"?",

It only started showing this gemming since 2.2.13. I'm just wondering if dodge rating is now higher than stam even with the lower % per rating, which doesn't make sense. I'm not going to pretend to know how Rawr is coded, I'm just wondering if this is intentional or a bug, since I've gotten used to using Rawr to get the best gems I can get for my new gear (like those 25 ToC pants) and it's all suddenly changed to dodge rating.",
