Loading the char in RAWR from the Armory shows only a defense rating of 480; 19 defense points missing ? why is that ? the char is only a level 73 - is this making a difference ? it should show the right value nevertheless, right ?",

      "Message": "Rawr is built around maximizing end-game gear. To that end we focus on level 80 characters. The conversion table from defense rating to defense skill changes based on your level. The higher your level the more rating you need to get a skill point. Rawr is using level 80 calcs to convert your defense rating to skill, hence the lower number.\r\n\r\nHoly",
