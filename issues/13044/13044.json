    "Description": "Running the Arcane talent build:\nRawr optimizes to 14% hit.  It should only optimize to 7% (for alliance, speaking of which, where is the Dreani buff to check off for 1% hit?).  I have a custom rule for 184 hit that used to work back in pre-litch king (in the past the rawr optizmizer used to spot say 2 hit points short of 7%).  Perhaps both of these issues could be fixed.",

The only thing that is not included is \"Arcane Focus\" because it only applies to Arcane Spells.  So... if you add the 3% from Arcane Focus to 14%, you get the 17% hit cap.\r\n\r\nYou just failed to consider that the buffs and talents are included in the 14% total.",

Rawr will suggest +hit gear for me even though I know I'm hit-capped as Arcane.  That gets kind of annoying.  Under Spell Info, it tells me I have a 98.83% hit rate with Arcane Blast even though with 2/3 Arcane Focus and 3/3 Precision, I'm at 13.83% hit.  I should only need 12% from gear with those talents to hit 100% of the time on Arcane Blast.  \r\n\r\nPlease explain that.",
