      "Message": "The issue was that Don Santos' rifle was not appearing in the list, even though it was on the character, and the dps value of it put it halfway down the list. (Value for dps was given on initial loading of the character.)\r\nAlso disappeared from the item cache if I changed to a different ranged weapon. Item cache was updated with upgrades from armory.\r\n\r\nMay have to do with the proc not being modeled yet.",

No cooldown at all as it can overwrite the buff.",
