    "Description": "Defense is being calculated incorrectly. 689 rating should be required to reach 540 skill. Running the optimizer with a requirement of 540 defense skill will equip a set of gear with 687 rating. The defense skill for this will show as 540 in rawr but the same rating in game is 539.",

      "Message": "Regarding the reported issue, the problem is it's rounding the result of dividing the defense rating by the amount of rating per defense point.  687 / 4.918498 = 139.676..., which rounds up to 140.  However, that's not the way the stat works in game.  I'll be submitting a patch to fix this.\r\n\r\nAs for the weirdness of that .xml file reporting 687 rating in 2.2.15 and 683 in the trunk, the 683 value is correct if my math is right, so the defense calculation *may* be broken in 2.2.15 and already fixed for the next version.\r\n\r\nPatch 3811 uploaded.",

Thanks for pointing that out.  687 is the correct rating counting the socket bonus.  Just had to refresh the girdle from WoWHead when running from the trunk.  A user error. :)\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, the patch is still needed to make sure 687 rating is being counted as 539 defense instead of 540.\r\n",
