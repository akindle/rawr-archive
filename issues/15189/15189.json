      "Message": "Well, you could just make it so selecting Crazy Alchemist's Potion doesn't invalidate the possible proc potion's buffs and just make the user select one they hope they get, or you could just make the proc effects buff improvements for Crazy Alchemist's Potion if you don't mind the list getting longer.\r\n\r\nI don't really see how they could be properly modeled to work automatically seeing as the effects are totally random and completely different. I'm curious how you'll be going about it.\r\n",

      "Message": "Sounds like a reasonable way to do it. Honestly, all those potions (except for the armor one) are such a small boost in a fight of significant length that averaging them out would probably be fine. Probably should be documented as such though.\r\n\r\nThe real question is to figure out what proc effects are possible for a given class, since similar items like Flask of the North and the old Mad Alchemist's Potion behave as such. If you want to take it that far that is. ;)\r\n",
