    "Description": "Equipping a 2h MH and a 1h OH causes all weapons in the MainHand slot to show \"NaN\" even though the 1h OH is not taken into account (or should not be).\n \nThe attached patch corrects this.\n \nOne side effect of this is that the presence of the OH seems to significantly devalue the MH items.  However, this may be intended.  (As a point of reference, equipping a staff and an OH does cause some devaluation of items in Rawr.Mage as well.  The effect may just be more noticeable here due to the comparatively large amount of DPS represented by the OH weapon.)",
