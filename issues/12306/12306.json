    "Description": "Elixir of Protection gives 800 *bonus armor*, which sounds right if that means \"without bear form multiplier\".\nÂ \nThe corresponding mixology buff gives 226 *armor*. I'll take your word for the the numeric value here, but I think that whichever value is used it is probably also *bonus armor* as otherwise the mixology addition is worth more than the base elixir to a bear, which seems unlikely.",

      "Message": "Did a quick trial under live (3.0.3) and the mixology effect part is indeed not multiplied by bear form there.  I got 1024 total from this elixir (without gear, and in any form) which is 800 per the tooltip plus 224 from Mixology.\r\n\r\nI mistyped above, by the way, Rawr is indicating not 226 but 266 for the Mixology affect on this elixir, which is much higher numerically than I'm seeing on live even ignoring the armor/bonus armor distinction.  I don't have access to the PTR, though, so it could be different there.  One can hope.",
