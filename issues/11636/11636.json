    "Description": "Set to level 83 target.\n \nChoker of Forceful Redemption - 48 ap, 21 expertise, 20 hit rating. Ranked as 9.22 dps points and 12.23 points overall.\n \nShattrath Choker of Power - 46 ap, no other stats. Ranked as 13.03 dps points.\n \nNot sure how the heck a neck with less AP got ranked higher than one with 2 more points of AP, regardless of any other stats. I'd definitely say there's a bug or something reveresed in some calcs with hit and/or expertise.\n \nAlso: Not showing avoided attacks or crit chance in the complex stats box. Everything in that window is blank.\n \nOne thing to check: Is the 2pc T4 set bonus included in calcs? It's a kinda nutty set bonus and may no longer be worthwhile in LK... but I'd love to be able to know that for sure (especially since some of the gear has multiple gem slots, and you can boost the value of the gear through LK gems).\n \nAttached is my char's .xml file that I was working with.",

I've seen it optimize my dps gear down to 198 hit rating (optimized for dps rating or survival rating).  That's close to 100 under cap, and I have plenty of gear to reach much higher +hit.  Also, can we add an option to optimize +hit as a condition? ",
