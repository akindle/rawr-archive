    "Description": "The zip file could contain a text warning, ie: after creating the zip file most zip programs will allow you to add popup text to be displayed when you open the file. This could contain a warning for users and perhaps prevent the brain dead and clueless issues like this appearing at least once a week.\n \nAlso the Known Issues section of the Issue Tracker could mention this (perhaps with a link to the Microsoft website?)\n \nCut n' paste from fail thread - I thought it more appropriate to be a real issue :)",

I'm not sure if its a user option though as to whether to show the popup and I don't think it would show if the user simply did a \"right click -> extract to here\" type operation. However it is better than nothing. \r\n\r\nIf you are using something like wzzip to create the zip in a batch file you can use the command\r\n\r\nwzzip -C -z d:\\temp\\test.zip\r\n\r\nto prompt for a comment.",
