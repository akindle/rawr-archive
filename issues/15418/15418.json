    "Description": "With the new pug loot system of \"Need before Greed\" disallowing need rolls on any item that's not your main armor class (i.e. Paladins can't roll need on mail, Druids can't roll need on cloth), what I've been doing when I end up in a random heroic on a fairly new 80 is filtering everything but the heroic I'm in, showing the \"Direct Upgrades\" list, and then opening each item shown in wowhead to see its armor type. Then, before each boss I'll tab around in the new wowhead pages to say to my group, \"If X drops, I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't DE it.\"\n \nI'd really like if I could cut out the middle steps involving wowhead, so for example if I go into options and check \"Display Item Types in Tooltips,\" I would see the Polished Mirror Helm in Rawr as [Head] (Mail) instead of simply [Head].\n \nThanks very much for your time.",
