    "Description": "Just noticed there seems to be no support for Resto Shaman Tier 9 (Garb) set bonuses in either Rawr.RestoSham or Rawr.Base/Buff.cs\nÂ \nAnother thing that seemed odd is in Rawr.Base/Buff.cs, the Elemental set (Regalia) is listed twice. Once alone in the \"Regalia\" region and again in the \"Battlegear\" region (with the Battlegear set next to it). I thought maybe it was there to make it viable for Rawr.Enhance, but I don't see that buff listed in the Rawr.Enhance buff list.",
