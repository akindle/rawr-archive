    "Description": "Description: Rawr/Firefox crashes when I try to load my Character from armory (hurkan/ Kargath eu; retribution paladin). respectively  when rawr begins to parse the char; firefox stops working or infinite loading without any result.\nWorks fine with other Rets from my server or with Rets from other servers with similar gear. Could only reproduce this with one other ret : cormag/ Kargath eu\nnormally parsing takes 5-20 seconds on my system but also waiting for about three hours yesterday was not bringing any other result\n \n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n \n   1. Launch Rawr\n   2. Load form armory\n   3. eu -> Kargath -> Hurkan \n   4. rawr loading char -> starting to parse -> FF stops working or infinite loading\nAdditional Information:\n \n    * Rawr v3 beta\n    * Intel Mac OS X 10.6.2\n    * Firefox 3.6.2\n    * latest Silverlight\nattached is the FF Bug report, although i didn't wait that long this time ;) maybe this helps?",

      "Message": "For anyone trying to parse their character and having problems... You can stop waiting around. Once it gets past the queue, if there is one, it almost certainly will take <10sec if it's going to work. No need to let it go for 3 hours.",

      "Message": "Please make sure to make a difference between CRASH and HANG.\r\nA crash is a fatal error.  Something in the code did a booboo and it causes the application to terminate abnormally.  There would usually be an errormessage of sorts (although it may be missing), but the application terminates.\r\nIf you're experiencing a crash, and it's in ret only, it's very likely this issue: http://rawr.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=16780\r\n\r\nA hang is something in the code causing it to keep doing something.  The application either isn't responsive or if it is, the results don't seem to come even after waiting a very long time.  (note that some parts of rawr such as the optimiser do indeed take minutes/hours to complete).\r\n\r\nYour post is a bit confusing as it's mentioning both hanging and crashing.\r\n",
