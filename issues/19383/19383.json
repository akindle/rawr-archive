    "Description": "I followed the instructions for starting to use Rawr 4 for Mages. But when I got to the part where it says the numbers on the Stats tab should match those on the Character window, I found that they didn't.\n \nAt first, I thought it might have to do with the buffs I chose (while doing this comparison, my character was totally unbuffed), but that would only explain if the numbers in Rawr were all higher, which they're not. Most Rawr numbers are higher, but Mana and Hit Chance are lower.I followed the instructions for starting to use Rawr 4 for Mages.
