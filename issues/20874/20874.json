    "Description": "There's a problem in optimization here. I tried to make a setup for low level bosses (5-man level 87) and to my surprise it reforged some available items to have more hit. It was already overcapped and it reached more than 13% with them.\n \nThis does not happen on another file which does not have 'blue diamonds'. (it correctly drops hit to very low levels)\n \nHere's the file that happens [attached]\n \n \nIt uses blue diamonds because it's supposed to be an unimportant spec for non raiding. It does not go away if 'Boss Handler' is ticked with boss there being lower than 88 and it does not fix either if the levels of single and multiple targets are set to 70.",
