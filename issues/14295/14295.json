      "Message": "The reason this came up is that there was a recent discussion about feral druids and why one-handed weapons weren't included in their modules for Cat and Bear.  It was made clear by Astrylian and a few other devs that they shouldn't be available in those modules because they don't make sense for feral druids, and indeed you can't check them, even though they are usable by that class.\r\n\r\nThe example of holy paladins and two-handers came up as well, that they shouldn't use them.  Thinking I had seen two-handed weapons available before in the Healadin module, I checked Rawr and in the cases mentioned, two-handed weapons are available.\r\n\r\nI did a quick check on WoWHead, only one item requiring level 61 or above is a two-handed weapon with spell power.  It's made by blacksmithing for level 70 toons, Hammer of Righteous Might.  http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32854\r\n\r\nSo while holy paladins can wield 2 handed weapons, there's not really any reason to.  Given all of this, the issue was created.",
