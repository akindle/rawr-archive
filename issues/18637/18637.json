    "Description": "Is it possible to add +hit to the optimizer settings for Kittys? As it stands right now, my current gearing has me under the hit cap by over 100 hit rating. While this isn't supposed to be a big deal for cats....well, it is. Nothing like mashing abilities 4 times before they actually hit. Would love to have a marker for the optimizer to keep myself within a reasonable range.",

      "Message": "Setting Avoided Attacks % to <= 0 will make the Optimizer get you the Hit needed to be dodged and not have your attacks just plain miss, so long as you're behind the target.  That means it will also be looking for Expertise rating gear as well, so if you do set to 0 and it's not working, make sure you've got some Expertise gear marked available as well in order to feed the machine.",
