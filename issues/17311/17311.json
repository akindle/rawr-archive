    "Description": "According to my Rawr v2.3.14 - Ymirjar's Lord's Gauntlets is less DPS (316.84) than Wrynn's Gauntlet of Conquest (371.16).  Am I missing something or is Rawr not calculating this correctly.  Ymirjar's numbers are all better across the board and its a higher level item.  Help me understand.  Thanks",
