    "Description": "On the TankDK Module, even sitting at 26 expertise skill is causing Rawr to still show the mob having a chance to dodge as if expertise was at 0. This interferes with the optimizer with any use of \"Target Dodge%\" condition as well.\nÂ \nExample of Optimizer Weapon Glitch:\nI always use a condition of \"Target Dodge% <= 0\" in order to make sure I am at the softcap for dodge. However, in v2.2.7 with this condition up, regardless of the number set, the optimizer removes any weapon equipped and leaves the weapon slot blank in its calculations, then optimizes every other piece of gear to compensate around not having a weapon equipped. This includes stacking an enormous amount of defense rating to make up for the lack of Stoneskin Gargoyle cause there is no weapon for a weapon enchant to be used.",
