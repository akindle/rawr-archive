    "Description": "I use Rawr to select my optimum gear most of the time... but that's just for my \"veterans\". For my newly dinged level 80's I mostly use it as a wish list, but it would be great to have both functions.\n \nIs it possible to add another \"diamond\" to check for gear that you want to get, e.g.- from heroics or by badges, change these into the normal green ones once you have them to be able to run the optimizer.\n \nIt would also be great to be able to export this wish list or show it based on source. E.g.- sorting it by instance for example showing:\n \nUtgarde Pinnacle [Normal]\n[Slot] [Drop Source] [Rating]\n[Slot] [Drop Source] [Rating] \n \nUtgarde Pinnacle [Heroic]\n[Slot] [Drop Source] [Rating]\n[Slot] [Drop Source] [Rating]\n \njust my thought, would really improve the way I think most people use Rawr already, the current optimizer includes all the gear from the selected filters, but doesn't really sort it in any accessible way in my opinion.",
