    "Description": "Problem\n======\nWhen importing a XML file in Simcraft from a saved Rawr file, Simcraft displayed a wrong glyph combination for a destruction warlock (Conflagrate, Life Tap, Metamorphosis instead of Conflagrate, Incinerate, Life Tap). The problem is caused by Rawr 2.3.11 saving Warlock Glyphs with a bit sequence that does not match what is displayed in the GUI.\n \nAnalysis\n=====\nXML file content:\n  <WarlockTalents>000000000000000000000000000003220030003000000000000000005203205210331051335230351.01000000011000000</WarlockTalents>\nBinary sequence generated by me according to the GUI glyphs I have set (Conflagrate, Incinerate, Life Tap)    \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->0100000011000000\nAs you can see, there's are additional \"zeroes\" in the bit sequence in the XML saved data, one of them in between the two \"enabled\" glyphs.\n \nWhat to do\n=======\nIf you fix it the \"right way\", ie, changing the XML saving code so that it matches the GUI, old XML files will load with the wrong glyph combination by Rawr.\nIf you fix it in another way, changing the Glyph positions in the GUI, other applications reading your XML will have to adapt, ofc.\nIf you don't to anything, other applications reading your XML will have to fix your bug themselves.",
