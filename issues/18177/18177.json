    "Description": "I downloaded the zip of rawr 2.3.20\nI got to extract and notice it says it will be 50 minutes till its done.\nI cancel and noticed everything extracted except the talent_images folder and everything in it.\nI then try to extract just that folder and says it will take 40 minutes to extract again.\nMy question is why? Are you compressing that folder so much that it takes intense cpu power to do fast?\nIs that folder needed for rawr to work properly and what is it for?",
