    "Description": "In the priorities tab I have Earth Shock prioritized above Flame Shock, which I assume would mean Flame shock should never cast, since they share a cooldown. However, unchecking Flame Shock drops my DPS from 7785 to 7414.",

With flame shock checked, it reports earth shock at \"11.88 PPM\" and 1048 dps.  When I uncheck flame shock, those values for earth shock do not change.\r\n\r\nAttaching my latest character file for reference.",
