    "ClosedComment": "Don&#39;t let it optimize that item by changing the Green Diamond to a Blue Diamond per the Optimizer Documentation. Then it won&#39;t try to gem it at all beyond what&#39;s already in it. We won&#39;t be implementing a further fix for this because it&#39;s about gear you should be replacing with dungeon blues.",

    "Description": "I have a freshly leveled rogue which happened to still have an item at level 85 from WotLK content. The optimizer overestimates its worth since it wants to put Cataclysm level gems in it. This is not possible since cataclysm gems require item level 285 on the item it will be socketed in.",
