    "Description": "This has happened both last night and tonight.\n \nOpen application, reset all caches, load character from armory.\nWindow just stays open with no errors at 0 of 2 tasks complete. (Can't cancel this window, but I'm sure that's a well-known bug.)\n \nIf I load a character, it tries and fails to retrieve the item cache from the armory as far as I can tell, every item in every display just says \"Downloading from Armory\".\n \nI have also tried having Silverlight delete the application data, same results exactly.\n \nMac OS 10.6.2\nSilverlight 3.0.40818.0",
