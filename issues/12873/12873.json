    "Description": "I tried optimizing my feral druid's kitty gear, and I was quite surprised that there was no option to add requirements to have hit and/or expertise over a certain point. The thing is I like  to be at or near hit/expertise cap, but the program puts more emphasis on Expertise cap then Hit. So when optimizing, I go from missing >1% total to having 5.6% miss from hit; 0% from Expertise.",
