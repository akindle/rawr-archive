    "Description": "In the list of finger enchantments in Rawr 5.0.2.0, all three STA ring enchants need to be changed:\n\n\nThe Greater Stamina enchant with value 160 STA should have value 240 STA (there was a tooltip error at one point, but in general STA enchants have 50% more budget than primary stats)\nThe Greater Stamina enchant with value 60 STA should be called just Stamina\nThe Stamina enchant with value 30 STA should be called Lesser Stamina\n\n\nI think the last two are due to Blizzard having rationalised the names this time round, so \"Greater\" can be used for all the MoP finger enchants.",
