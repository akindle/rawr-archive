    "Description": "This actually happens fairly routinely. It seems to always revolve around the Runed Dragon's Eyes and how Rawr is using them. After 8 hours of running Optimize, I get results and I accept them. Rawr swaps out all the items, but as I'm looking around, I notice a pretty obvious DPS upgrade:\n \nOptimize had put a Runed Dragon's Eye + Potent Monarch Topaz into a chestpiece giving a 6 crit bonus. I instead switch these out for 2 Runed Scarlet Rubies, dropping the 6 crit bonus, and enabling me to move the runed dragon's eye into Pennant Cloak which activated a 5 spell power bonus. This resulted in a DPS increase from 6995.52 to 6996.78. And this was run on max thouroughness.\n \nAttached is the XML file after I made the switch. I've sometimes been able to move gems around and swap out some items after running Optimize several times and increase DPS by 20+. These are fairly easy switches too. For instance, I know that if I drop 9 spell power and 8 crit for 19 spell power, I'm effectively trading 8 crit for 10 spell power. This is always a DPS gain. I also know that in some cases, this isn't a DPS gain because I would lose the socket bonus. However, in the case of an item where the other socket is blue, it would still be a DPS gain, because instead of having:\n \n9 SP + 8 Spirit + 9 SP + 8 Crit + 6 Crit (Socket bonus) for a total of 18 SP and 18.4 crit, I get a flat 38 SP.\n \nThe only reason Rawr is saying 2 Runed Scarlet Ruby is less DPS is because instead of a Purified Twilight Opal, it puts a Runed Dragon Eye in there. So instead I get 41 SP and 14 crit. However, in the item above, I have a Runed Scarlet Ruby and a socket bonus of 5 spell power that hasn't been activated. A Purified Twilight Opal isn't enough of a DPS gain to activate the Socket Bonus, so it sticks with a Runed Scarlet Ruby. It can't put a Runed Dragon's Eye in there, because all three have been used already. Yet I can see the DPS gain...\n \n37 Spell Power vs 19 in the necklace (18 SP gain)\n38 SP vs 41 SP and 14 crit in the chest piece (3 SP, 14 crit loss)\n \nIf SP is 1.68 per DPS, and crit is 1.67 -- then this comes out to +30.24, -(5.04+23.38)=-28.42, which is a 1.82 DPS gain. Now, the actual Solution DPS returned a DPS gain of 1.26, but it's still a DPS again, and that's just one gem swap amongst 2 items... I haven't looked at any of the others, and it all adds up.",

      "Message": "i have found about the same bug. For me when i let optimize run for ~6 hours it said i should replace my cloak a ring and a couple of gems. Now the gems that were chosen were correct, although they were not in the right slots of the gear. I have enforce gem requirement on. And i use a metagem that needs 2 blue gems. All my items have eighter red or yellow sockets (and 1blue socket in my necklace) so to maximize dps you would use 19sp or +9sp and +8hit or +9sp and +8 spirit. Now it would put blue gems in my chest, while i have a blacksmith socket in my belt, so now i wouldnt get my chest socket bonus but i do have a 19 sp gem in my belt. So it should have put the blue gem in my belt and the red in my chest.",
