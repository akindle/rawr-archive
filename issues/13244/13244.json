    "Description": "I sometimes have problems loading some Chars from Armory with 2.2.4. It does all the three stepsÂ´and shows up the icons and stats, but status doesn't disapear and I can't use the program. It always works fine e.g. with my Mage and my Priest but sometimes I get stuck when loading my Druid or the Paladin. 2.2.3 works fine with all chars!",
