    "Description": "Okay, I'm well aware that mongoose is often the best enchant for druids, however my Rawr currently shows it better by such a vast quantity that it seems very odd. Darinth of Lothar is the character I'm using it on at the moment.\n \nMongoose, for me, is showing at about 2.5x the value of the next closest enchant, berserking. This seemed odd so I went in and edited the EnchantCache.xml to add in a Mongoose2, 3, and 4.\n \nMongoose 2 was a straight permanent 30 agility and 0.005% increase in attack speed, 25% of mongoose's value.\n \nMongoose 3 was a straight 120 agility and still 0.005%.\n \nMongoose 4 was 120 agility and 0.2% attack speed.\n \n \n \nMongoose destroyed the mongoose 2 enchant, being valued at 3x+ the value.\n \nMongoose still beat mongoose 3, though only by about 5-10%.\n \nMongoose 4 beat mongoose, but once again only by about 10%.\n \n \n \nThis means that mongoose is being modeled in such a fashion that a 120 agi 2% increase in attack speed with only a 15 second 1 PPM uptime is beating even a straight 120 permanent agility and 0.5% increase in attack speed. It is only just barely loosing to the permanent version of itself. Is something going on screwy with my system? Is mongoose's value currently off for some reason? or am I just certifiably crazy. *_*\n \nThis was reposted from the discussions, where the comment was made by Astrylian that I may be mis-entering the haste. The specific XML I used is:\n \n<Enchant>\n    <Id>6000</Id>\n    <Name>Mong2</Name>\n    <Slot>TwoHand</Slot>\n    <Stats>\n      <Agility>30</Agility>\n      <PhysicalHaste>0.005</PhysicalHaste>\n    </Stats>\n  </Enchant>\n  <Enchant>\n    <Id>6001</Id>\n    <Name>Mong3</Name>\n    <Slot>TwoHand</Slot>\n    <Stats>\n      <Agility>120</Agility>\n      <PhysicalHaste>0.005</PhysicalHaste>\n    </Stats>\n  </Enchant>\n  <Enchant>\n    <Id>6002</Id>\n    <Name>Mong4</Name>\n    <Slot>TwoHand</Slot>\n    <Stats>\n      <Agility>120</Agility>\n      <PhysicalHaste>0.02</PhysicalHaste>\n    </Stats>\n  </Enchant>\n \nMy apologies for not having posted this earlier. My authenticator died and I've been locked out of my WoW account. *_* Also, attaching copy of the character file as requested.",
