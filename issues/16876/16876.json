    "Description": "I see the following on Rawr 2.3.12.  Ran through several iterations of expected and unexpected behavior for the Ashen Band of Endless Wisdom.\n \nIf I ctrl-click an empty item diamond (shows blue) then the optimizer ignores other gem options as expected.\n \nIf I first click (no ctrl) an empty item diamond (shows green) then ctrl-click the same diamond (shows blue), the optimizer does not ignore other gem options, as if the diamond was still green.",

If you had more than one you would see the blue diamond on the one you clicked and green on the rest. Just go unclick the green from the others and you are left with blue.",
