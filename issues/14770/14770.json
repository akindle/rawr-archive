    "Description": "Could you please change ItemCache.xml and other cache files location to something like All Users/Application Data? Under Windows 7 UAC is preventing /Program Files/... contents modification and it is really annoying to receive error messages on exit (and killing Rawr from Task Manager, because there are no other possibilities to close it in such case) each time I forgot run it as Administrator.\nP.S.: Yes, I know that I can place Rawr in come other location and it will work, but it's much better to make things right, isn't it?",
