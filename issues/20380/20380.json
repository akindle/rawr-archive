    "Description": "I'm sorry that I have a lot of questions/concerns and I promise you I'm not \"trolling\" or anything. Some of my stats on battle.net/WoW and Rawr aren't the same. I made sure to unbuff myself on Rawr and I'm assuming battle.net's stats are without buffs (and without bear form) because I just double-checked them. My stats on Rawr are calculated for my bear form as shown in the Class/Model option. However, this should not affect some stats such as Agility. Rawr says that I have 3940 Agility while battle.net says I have 3622. Mastery is also different. However, some stats such as Expertise are spot on. Am I missing something here or is this an error? Here is my character file and the link to my character on battle.net. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/deathwing/maybeizuck/simple",
