    "Description": "I use Rawr for tuning my high level characters, but I use the in game Pawn addon for getting a quick and dirty idea of whether to consider an item or not.\n \nI typically use the Relative Stat Values -> Export to Pawn function to keep the two in sync.\n \nBut I've noticed that for my melee toons the Displayed statistics (and therefore the exported values) don't place any value on DPS or weapon speed, both of which seem like they should matter.\n \nAm I missing something?",
