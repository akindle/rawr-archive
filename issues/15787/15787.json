    "Description": "Description: The current order of character definition UI elements suggests, in tradition of reading left to right, that one should select their Race before they select their Class. Also, the UI elements suggest that any Class can be any Race, or vice versa, which allows the user freedom of selection for theory and the selection should remain free. However, this design makes it unclear as to which Class/Race combination can actually be selected in-game.\nÂ \nSuggestion: Move the Class drop down menu to the left of the Race drop down menu to allow for more traditional progressive thought. Depending on the selected class, color code the entries of the Race drop down menu to indicate their availability for Race/Class combinations in-game.",
