    "Description": "Hello! Great product. Figured I'd see how my Prot Warrior stacks up. Found a pretty significant bug that caused the undervaluing of the Defense Rating stat.\n \nTo demonstrate problem:\n1) Load your friendly neighborhood protection warrior with File -> Load From Armory\n2) On Comparison frame, select Custom > Item Budget\n3) Notice that 10 Defense rating is ranked with 0 points, while in fact it should be much higher -- even after crit cap reached.\n \nTo fix, I took a look at r29116 and made the following modification:\nCalculationsProtWarr.cs, Line 214:\nChange:\nfloat defSkill = (float)Math.Floor(stats.DefenseRating * ProtWarr.DefenseRatingToDefense);\nTo:\nfloat defSkill = (float)(stats.DefenseRating * ProtWarr.DefenseRatingToDefense);\n \nAfter compiling the change, 10 defense rating is now ranked above 10 parry rating but below 10 dodge rating, which seems about right based on other theorycrafting.\n \nThis change is not perfect, and I don't know enough of the code to fix the problems. The change breaks the following things that I can notice. The breaks seem less severe than the previous problem however:\n \n1) Defense may be slightly overvalued now, but that seems better than totally ignored in some cases\n2) OverallPoints seems to be miscalculated somehow. In practice, I'm seeing 10 defense rating as an Overall of 54.69, but the mitigation section is 55.66.\n \nI'm sorry I don't have time to get a better fix in that resolves the other two issues, but my time is limited today.\n \nAlso still existing is that 10 resilience adds 0 mitigation or survival. On most melee this would be true, but in reality bleeds and spells will do less damage. Is the 0 intentional?",

      "Message": "Thanks for the report, I'll take a look a little later today to see if that makes sense.\r\nThe resiliance thing I believe is intentional. Not all bosses do DoTs (normal spells without a dot would not be affected by resiliance), and stacking resiliance just for one or two encounters wouldn't make much sense when it gimps you on every other one.",

      "Message": "I made a change so that during the comparison calc it will parse greater values of defense rating to get a number. It was only doing 2 each way, which wouldn't change your defense at all.\r\nThis should get you the result you wanted without the side effects you mentioned, check it out and let me know.",
