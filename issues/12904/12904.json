    "Description": "I found several issues with the sheet:\nGlyph of shadowbolt decreases dps (without glyph of lifetap or 4t7)\nImp Lifetap does not increase dps (tried without lifetap glyph and 4t7)\nEquipping tier pieces doesn't check the tier bonuses on the buff tab.\nThe item list, when sorting by overall or alphabetical, appears empty.  Items are still there but not visable.\nIt's not possible to change the gem in the belt bs socket.\nOnly mana potions are selectable.\n \nThings you probably already know but I'm listing them to be sure ; )\n%healt talents not implemented (death embrace, Drain soul, Decimation)\nBackdraft sequence not implemented\nDoomguard and Infernal not implemented.\nPet buff not implemented (raid buff, raid debuff and pet food)\n \nSugestion\nHaving some way to permanently see a stat (like total dps) would help when selecting glyphs or distributing loose talent points.\n \nGreat work ^^ can't wait for the shhet to be completly operational.",

The mana pot selector will be gone soon, it doesn't do anything anyway.\r\n\r\nThings you probably already know: yep, I know of these issues.\r\nTotal DPS: it's at the bottom in the newest version.",
