    "Description": "Upon starting RAWR the window to switch to beta always pops up. Was a problem in .13 and .14 and was supposed to be resolved in .15. All I want is to not see the window about updating to the beta. I appreciate all the hard work you guys are doing but I'm not interested in the beta at this point and time and wish just to use .15 w/o the added nag window to update to 3.0 every time I use the program. Any info would be appreciated. <3",

I just formatted my machine (not related to Rawr) and re-downloaded 2.3.15 and it still has the \"A message from the Rawr development team\" popup every time I load the program. Is it a fix I need to download?",
