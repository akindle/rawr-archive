    "Description": "There are a number of other items that discuss Life Tap, but not this issue, I think.\n \nIn my spell rotation I often Life Tap towards the beginning of a fight in order to proc the Glyph of Life Tap (gain 20% of Spirit as Spell Power for 20 seconds).  I then typically Life Tap again as it runs out in order to continue the glyph's benefit.   This makes a notable difference in damage output.\n \nHowever, I see no way to include this in my spell rotation in RAWR.  Am I missing something?\n \nAlso, I suspect that taking this rotation into account could affect how I should gear/gem for Spirit...",
