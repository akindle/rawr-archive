    "Description": "Hello, some Items, purchasable for emblems of frost, are listed in the wrong place; they are described as \"purchasable with XX [Emblem of Frost] and XXgXXsXXc\", and appear as fraction reputation loot, not as special currency loot, which is not correct. I attached an image to make clear what I mean ... my English sucks.",
