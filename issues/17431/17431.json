      "Message": "What Jothay is referring to is your current \"Chaotic\" Meta requires 2 Blue to activate (which you meet at the cost of some slot bonuses, such as putting pussiant in wrist instead of chest or legs). If you put a \"Relentless\" in your helm you lose 5 DPS but ALL the items you listed are now in a seemingly appropriate place in list. I am posting your toon for you so others can help you out more if you still don't understand. \r\n\r\nOther items of note are your actual gemming choices so I ask a favor:\r\n Replace Chaotic with Relentless (~5 DPS loss) and Pussiant with Inscribed (~15 DPS gain) for a 9-10 Dps gain with 2 gem swaps\r\n(not sure why you are gemming so much ArP but Rawr shows better DPS using Inscribed (yellow slots) and Bold (red slots) gems)",

(in fact I got you near 1300 DPS more by selecting some \"standard\" buffs and giving you both drums)",

Something in the program is not wright. If you swap some of my gear around I still get sometimes that t10 lesser is better than t10 higher.. Some problem with the code or something.\r\n\r\nAbout my gear thank you for all the posts but I'm still tweaking and I'm farming banner of victory so all the gemmed arm pen will give more dps than the set bonuses.\r\n\r\n",
