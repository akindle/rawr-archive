    "Description": "Not a bug but an issue that affects usability.  In 2.x Rawr displays a bar at the bottom with the summary of the result (ie score and dps done for the solution).  This bar does not seem to be present in Rawr3.  This makes it much harder to see the impact of settings changes at a glance because you have to swap back to the stats screen every time.",
