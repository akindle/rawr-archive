    "Description": "Load a DK (in my case a unholy spec, didn't try any other specs however)\nAnd goto buffs, and check Elixer of Expertise, and Expertise food, the stats tab will not update with the new expertise rating.\nAlso, as one step further, attempted to optimize with additional requirements of \"Target Dodge %\" \"<\" \"0.00\" and it regemmed all of my gear with Stam/Expertise gems.\nÂ \nAlso tried a new totally blank DK, and going into buffs, and checking both of the above, and the stats still showed 0 for Expertise.",
