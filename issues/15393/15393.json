    "Description": "Obviously not a priority issue, but just want to check that I'm going about this the right way.\nAs I understand it, the only way to get new patch 3.3 items into Rawr3 is to equip them and load entire character from Armory?\n \n1. Banner of Victory not showing up (item is from patch 3.2.2) until loading from Armory with it equipped\n2. Loading from Armory means having to go back through each gearslot and clicking all available items that could possible be optimal. This needs to be done for each new item, meaning there's no way to run Optimize accounting for two new-in-3.3 pieces of gear that occupy the same slot?\n3. Either have to wait til 3.3 comes standard with new 3.3 database or with feature enabled to update item cache somehow?\n \nEither way, big thanks to everyone who works on this stuff so I don't have to spend two years trying to learn programming. I'll just make movies instead.",
