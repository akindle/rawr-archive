      "Message": "It looks like DPSDK does not support talent optimizations well enough. There is a thread safety issue, the calculations store talents in calculation options which is not a thread safe operation since several calculations with different talents can be going on at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can go to Tools->Options->General Settings and disable Use Multithreading.",
