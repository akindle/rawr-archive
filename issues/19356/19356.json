    "Description": "Was testing the new beta and it was quite fast. Switched to the Options Tab and clicked the innervate delay checkbox and the custom rotation button and Rawr became very unresponsive. It never displayed the dropdown for custom rotation and after that all other actions had long delays, eg: clicking the Stats tab took over a minute to change the tab, clicking the gear button is so slow I'm not sure whether it's working or not - the button gains the \"highlight\" but the dropdown never appears. Trying to click a gear button on the paper doll takes about a minute just to display the mouseover tooltip, the actual click event hasn't fired after two or three minutes. Even Firefox (3.6.13) feels less responsive now. It's using about 290MB of ram but practically no CPU, even when trying to switch tabs or click buttons in Rawr.\nÂ \nWell, actually it shows a max of about 12% CPU usage on one core of an i7-950 when trying to click a button. But that only happens for a few seconds after trying to do something in Rawr and it drops back to nothing.",

This this the dropdown appeared and everything remained responsive. \r\n\r\nPossibly, its related to how long Rawr had been open, or the fact I'd been switching between the various tabs, setting raid buff options etc. before trying to change the custom rotation. Will test more and see if I can get it to repeat the behaviour.",

I'll be using Rawr a lot more in the next week or two so I'll keep an eye out to see if it happens again.\r\n\r\nAs for my comment about switching tabs, that was so you know I didn't *just* go into the options tab and click one dropdown and it hung. I'd been flicking through all the tabs changing settings with no problems, no noticeable change in responsiveness. It may also indicate that there is some combination of options that cause a problem - eg: setting the various buffs + ticking innervate + clicking the dropdown may be the cause. \r\n\r\nI'm assuming Rawr is multi-threaded? Because if it's an infinite loop on a single threaded app then I'd expect nothing to respond at all. Things were responding, just with glacial slowness :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've attached my character file. I'm not sure how much use it's going to be now. I couldn't save it when Rawr was hanging. I tried but the save dialog just never appeared. I think the gear, options, etc are all basically the same as when it hung though.",

Memory usage climbed in Firefox again and it became unusable. For example, trying to scroll the item list using the scrollbar would work but it'd take upwards of thirty seconds before anything happened. Clicking the gear choice dropdown would eventually highlight it blue (indicating that it'd received the focus) but never actually display the dropdown - at least not in the couple minutes I waited for it.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is anything else I can provide to help.",

I just opened the weapons list and the same problem kicked in. I've attached my character file. I didn't manage to select a new weapon and save it because the UI becomes so unresponsive the save dialog never appears.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be fine before that, I was able to switch to chest and cloak and scroll through those lists just fine. I also shut it down and reloaded it to see if that made a difference. Same results - other gear choices would be fine but switch to weapon and it grinds to a halt.\r\n\r\nI'll try a complete reboot and post results after that.",

      "Message": "Its actually consistently doing it for me on FF since it happened yesterday. IE8 works perfectly but Firefox lags out when I go into the gear choices and pick weapons. I just tried it again before typing this;\r\n1. Opened Rawr (at EJ)\r\n2. opened the boom1 save file\r\n3. Clicked gear-main hand\r\n4.  Tried to scroll down the list of weapons using the mousewheel, it scrolled maybe three of four lines then became unresponsive.\r\n\r\nIt's not completely locked up, for example if I click the page down arrow on the weapon list it sits there for 30 seconds then it'll scroll down a bit. Or if I hover over an item it'll sit there for a little while then the tooltip will appear. But its unresponsive enough that I can't get the File menu to popup or reforging or a few other things in the ui.\r\n\r\nI tried loading my character from armory and it populates ok. Then I can save it (boom2). I tried loading the new file and the weapon chooser remains responsive, but it's \"glitchy\". ie: It'll scroll ok for a few lines then it'll lag out for a few seconds, then it becomes responsive again, scroll a bit more, lag out again and so on. Also the lag outs seem to get longer. The first few lasted a few seconds. After tinkering for a few minutes the lag outs are more like 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nWatching performance in the task manager I see big CPU spikes that correspond to trying to scroll the list. Also the position indicator in the scroll bar for the gear list appears to have stopped working. It no longer moves in relation to where I am in the gear list and clicking on it (or anywhere in the scroll bar) causes a massive CPU spike and a lag out for 5-10 seconds.\r\n\r\nUsing FireFox 3.6.13, no extensions, no themes, plugins; Foxit Reader 1.0.1.1117, Java Deployment Toolkit 6.0.200.2, MS Office 2003, Mozilla Default plugin 1.0.0.15, Nvidia 3D Vision 7.17.12.6309 (2 different ones), Shockwave Flash 101.53.64 and Silverlight 4.0.51204.0\r\n\r\nIf there is anymore information I can provide let me know.",

Not much of a surprise there since Silverlight is MS. Will update if the problems persist in IE8.\r\n\r\nAgain, if there is any further info I can provide let me know.
