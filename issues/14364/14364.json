    "Description": "Loaded my elemental shaman into Rawr today, and done some playing around with things. I think I've got things set properly, but I've noticed Rawr is only suggesting I gem one blue gem in my gear and replace the 2nd blue gem I have with a red gem, which breaks my meta gem requirement. I've attached my char file. The blue gem it wants me to replace is in my chest while it leaves the one in my legs alone.",
