    "Description": "Blizzard announced that as season 10 starts (today/tomorrow for US/EU), the 371 Vicious items that seemed unused will become buyable with Honor, replacing the s9 365 set.\nThey should be added to Rawr (esp. because they might well be better than the 359 items for some specs, and thus be BiS among non-locked-out items).",
