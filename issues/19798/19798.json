There are plenty of instances where a relevant stat might be reforged to something else, like expertise to crit in DPSWarr.&#42; Moonkin is a documented case where overriding is necessary to prevent the optimizer from doing something stupid in Moonkin&#39;s case &#40;possibly others&#41;.",

    "Description": "Got a new weapon with hit on it the other day for my restosham. The optimizer wants to reforge the mastery to spirit instead of the Hit to Spirit as the models ignores all hit on items.\nÂ \nI have often thought it would be nice to be able to see the \"irrelevant stats grayed out in the tool-tips.",

      "Message": "Wouldn't it be safe to assume that if an item has irrelevant stats that ONLY those would even be considered for reforging.\r\nI can't possibly see how reforging a relevant stat could ever beat an irrelevant one.  Might make the optimiser run a bit faster since it can prune of a section of the potential paths.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if an item has 2 irrelevant reforgable stats, then whichever is highest is the ONLY one to consider in the reforge.\r\n\r\nI don't really see why you would allow overriding.  If the stat does have some effect (nomatter how small) on the model, it shouldn't even be marked as irrelevant.\r\nThe only use for overriding I can see is if you would want to simply downright refuse to upgrade to any items with irrelevant stats.  But if an item is already equipped that doesn't make much sense :)",
