    "Description": "I hope this doesn't duplicate an existing issue... I searched but couldn't find a match:\n \nI was getting some odd optimization choices for Bear gear, and found that my Therapeutic Cloak (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=38758) is thought by Rawr to have negative bonus armor.  The item has 94 armor (and no bonus armor), but Rawr thinks it has 188 armor and -94 bonus armor.  The net effect of course is to vastly overvalue the item.\n \nI think I read somewhere that Rawr is forced to estimate bonus armor from ilevel and listed armor values, is that right?.  Perhaps at the very least a check should be added against negative values from this algorithm.",
