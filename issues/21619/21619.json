    "Description": "I have not been able to find a \"Suggested Fix\" and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix, then I am aware than my time was wasted for searching for something that is either buried or non-existent.   I do not wish either of us to experience wasted time.  However, I DID search every part of the site that had to do with issues, FAQs and RAWR problems of all sorts.\n \n== Version: 4.2.5.0 ==\n \n== Error Message ==\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at Rawr.Optimizer.AvailableItemGenerator.PopulateAvailableIds(Boolean positiveCostItemsAvailable)\n   at Rawr.Optimizer.AvailableItemGenerator..ctor(List`1 availableItems, Boolean generateDirectUpgrades, Boolean templateGemsEnabled, Boolean overrideRegem, Boolean overrideReenchant, Boolean overrideReforge, Boolean slotFiltering, Boolean positiveCostItemsAvailable, Character[] characters, CalculationsBase[] models)\n   at Rawr.Optimizer.ItemInstanceOptimizer.PopulateAvailableIds(List`1 availableItems, Boolean templateGemsEnabled, Boolean overrideRegem, Boolean overrideReenchant, Boolean overrideReforge, Boolean positiveCostItemsAvailable)\n   at Rawr.Optimizer.ItemInstanceOptimizer.InitializeItemCache(Character character, List`1 availableItems, Boolean overrideRegem, Boolean overrideReenchant, Boolean overrideReforge, Boolean templateGemsEnabled, CalculationsBase model, Boolean optimizeFood, Boolean optimizeElixirs, Boolean mixology, List`1 talentSpecs, Boolean mutateTalents, Boolean mutateGlyphs, Boolean positiveCostItemsAvailable)\n   at Rawr.UI.OptimizeWindow.OptimizeButton_Click(Object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n   at System.Windows.EventRoute.InvokeHandlersImpl(Object source, RoutedEventArgs args, Boolean reRaised)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseEventImpl(DependencyObject sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.Button.OnClick()\n   at System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.OnMouseLeftButtonUp(MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n   at System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.InvokeHandler(Delegate handler, Object target)\n   at System.Windows.EventRoute.InvokeHandlersImpl(Object source, RoutedEventArgs args, Boolean reRaised)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.ReRaiseEventAs(DependencyObject sender, RoutedEventArgs args, RoutedEvent newEvent)\n   at System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.InvokeHandler(Delegate handler, Object target)\n   at System.Windows.EventRoute.InvokeHandlersImpl(Object source, RoutedEventArgs args, Boolean reRaised)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseEventImpl(DependencyObject sender, RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseTrustedEvent(RoutedEventArgs args)\n   at System.Windows.Input.InputManager.ProcessStagingArea()\n   at System.Windows.Input.InputProviderSite.ReportInput(InputReport inputReport)\n   at System.Windows.Interop.HwndMouseInputProvider.ReportInput(IntPtr hwnd, InputMode mode, Int32 timestamp, RawMouseActions actions, Int32 x, Int32 y, Int32 wheel)\n   at System.Windows.Interop.HwndMouseInputProvider.FilterMessage(IntPtr hwnd, WindowMessage msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, Boolean& handled)\n   at System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource.InputFilterMessage(IntPtr hwnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, Boolean& handled)\n   at MS.Win32.HwndWrapper.WndProc(IntPtr hwnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, Boolean& handled)\n   at MS.Win32.HwndSubclass.DispatcherCallbackOperation(Object o)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.InternalRealCall(Delegate callback, Object args, Int32 numArgs)\n   at MS.Internal.Threading.ExceptionFilterHelper.TryCatchWhen(Object source, Delegate method, Object args, Int32 numArgs, Delegate catchHandler)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\nI have tried manually creating the character and filling in all gems, enchants, gearing, etc.  The error persisted.\n \nIdea: If the developers know this error notification was coded into the program, it must serve a specific purpose.  Why not list the error statements, the possible causes (since one had to be in mind to create the error message) and fixes for the error codes/statements in RAWR?",

      "Message": "Rawr has a generic \"catch all errors\" type system, any error (such as a null reference error like this one) would throw back up to the generic system with standard stack tracing. Unless we put in specific catches in specific places to know exactly what an error is, the Suggested Fix section won't populate. Common places we put in suggested fixes are like when loading a character from the armory, we recognize a no internet connectivity error, or a parse error of the resulting XML file that's generated.",
