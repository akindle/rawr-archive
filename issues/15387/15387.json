    "Description": "The item Surgeon's Needle (ID:50227) is marked as Alliance Only but it is available to Horde (not sure if it's available to both factions or if it's Horde Only as I have no way to find out). For a quick fix, go into the Rawr Item Editor, find the item and set the Faction to Neutral.",

I took a look at the code and it looks like there is code to set the newItem.Faction to the oldItem.Faction if the faction from Wowhead comes in as ItemFaction.Neutral.  I'm seeing this code at or around line 965 in Item.cs from the 49604 version.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer - While I am a C# programmer, I'm not familiar with the Rawr code so take all of the above as such.",
