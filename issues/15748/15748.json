    "Description": "So i downloaded and optimized my mage in the new Rawr v2.3.5 and found it optimized my arcane mage for 1413 hit rating  \\o/\n \nSo i thought in the new version the optimizer requirement must have been changed to percentages, so I took hit raiting from > 187.00  to > 7.00 and got the same result.\n \nSo, am I missing somthing here?\n \nlol, just realised its also Gemed sp & hit gems and i did not have them selected.",
