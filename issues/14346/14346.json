    "Description": "It appears that inn 2.2.20 \"The Easiest Boss\" has more restrictive settings then \"The Average Boss\", and I am seeing a DPS drop when switching from average to easiest boss. For instance The Average Boss is currently set to stun for 5020ms every 488s, while The Easiest Boss is set to stun for 5000ms every 37s.\nÂ \n~Droid",
