    "Description": "The issue in question is the trinket Sorrowsong: http://www.wowhead.com/item=56400\n \nYour spells that damage a target below 35% health grant 1710 spell power for 10 sec.  Cannot activate again for 10 sec after bonus expires.\n \nThis means it is activated when the target is below 35% health for 10 seconds with a 20 second cooldown. I was thinking this could be linked somehow by way of the Boss Handler.",
