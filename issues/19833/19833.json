    "Description": "Currently missing Don Rodrigo's Fabulous Necklace (BoE world drop) from the list of neck items (item id 67137). Has similar stats to the Necklace of Strife (although weighted more towards mastery) so this isnt particularly urgent.\nÂ \nI did search all tickets to see if this has been reported already but appears not to have been.",
