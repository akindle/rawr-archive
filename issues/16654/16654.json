To check security policy you can go to administrative tools in control panel and open Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Configuration. On the left menu select Runtime Security Policy. Look for anything that would be related to Socket Access being disabled. Most likely the settings under Machine node will be the one relevant, but by default Rawr should fall under My Computer Zone which is given FullTrust permission. If this is a corporate computer or something it's possible that admins might have set some special policies.",

      "Message": "Actually it looks like this is not code access security issue, but a winsock error which has the following explanation:\r\n\r\nPermission denied. \r\nAn attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. An example is using a broadcast address for sendto without broadcast permission being set using setsockopt(SO_BROADCAST). \r\nAnother possible reason for the WSAEACCES error is that when the bind function is called (on Windows NT 4 SP4 or later), another application, service, or kernel mode driver is bound to the same address with exclusive access. Such exclusive access is a new feature of Windows NT 4 SP4 and later, and is implemented by using the SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option.\r\n\r\nThis is rather strange for port 80. I'm not sure exactly what could be going on. You can try running NETSTAT -ano from command prompt and write down the PID number and check in task manager what process is having the PID.\r\n\r\nI would still suspect some firewall could be blocking the port.",
