    "Description": "I have the \"Use multithreading\" option ticked, but the Optimizer only uses 2 threads.  It would be really really really useful if we could move to 4 threads.  This is particularly important since for both Arcane and Fire, I tend to get suboptimal solves unless I \"Ctrl+Click to get 10x the Thoroughness\", which I'd really like to speed up any way I can :-)",
