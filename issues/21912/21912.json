    "Description": "Using the resto shaman config (haven't tested with others) when I select to filter out \"Misc\" off-hands and only leave shields selected as soon as I click apply.  I lose a bunch of things that have nothing to do with off hands.  For example, all rings except the rings that I currently have equipped disappear as selections.  I have confirmed it is the offhand.  I tried unchecking just one things at a time until I narrowed it down to this item, as soon as you reselect \"misc\" off-hands the items come back.\nÂ \nIt seems to be affecting rings, trinkets, back, and neck.",
