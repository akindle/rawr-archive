    "Description": "It seems that the Scryer Procc on the Shattered Sun Pendant of Might is being modeled as +4.35 weapon damage.  Is this correct?  +Weapon damage scales with haste, as far as I have seen, this neck has a 45 second internal cooldown that leads to ~1ppm.  Doing ~350 damage per procc.",
