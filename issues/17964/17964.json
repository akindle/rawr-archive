    "Description": "Working on a Blood Tank spec.\n \nWith no 'experimental' bits checked, Improved Icy Touch has a negative mitigation value.  Heart strike also has a negative mitigation value, as well as a pretty large negative threat value.\n \nWith Additive mitigation, Imp. Icy Touch is positive, but Heart Strike's still negative.\n \n'Experimental Code' shrinks Heart Strike's negative value by about 75% (still negative though), but Improved Icy Touch starts doing something really strange.  Whereas before, each point was around -180ish mit. & +75 threat,  the first point of Imp. Icy Touch is worth about *NEGATIVE 58K mitigation* & 0 threat. The second and third points each add back a little over 1k mit., so it's \"only\" -56k at 3/3.\n \nBoth experimental & additive together, the heart strike's about the same as experimental code alone,  and Imp. Touch tones down, to -12k mit. for the first point and a little over +200 each for the second and third.",

However, you're right that we shouldn't see it being severely negative.  I had this stuff worked out at some point, but might have broken it while trying to get the new rotation stuff implemented.",

      "Message": "Ahh... Figured out why there is probably a threat drop when using HS.  The rotation changes from a basic 2 IT, 2 PS, 2 BS type rotation without HS, to a 1,1,6 HS more normal \"blood rotation\" when HS is used since that's one of the key triggers that I use to determine which rotation to use as the baseline.  2 ITs are very valueable threat-wise, even if they don't make alot of sense to spam actually in-combat.   \r\n\r\nI'm not sure on the IIT, I need to do more digging.  Looking at your build, it seems odd that IIT would be so different.  Esp. since I'm not seeing those kind of numbers when I use my blood spec so it's probably a logic or rotation breakdown somewhere.",
