    "Description": "The problem that recently developed after the last patch where survivability but no DPS was showing in the optimizer has reversed now in 4.2.1.  Now only DPS shows in the optimizer and no survivability.  I believe this is different from Issue #21140, so I have posted it separately.\nÂ \nFile has been added.  Please see email directly to Kavan.",
