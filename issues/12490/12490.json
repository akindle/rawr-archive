      "Message": "There's just one \"major\" issue with it that I didn't quite know how to fix: the ghoul doesn't quite do enough damage. Maybe you know better then me about how do calculate it.\r\n\r\nI chose 16.7 as AP divisor and 101.3 as the weapon base damage because it worked for the numbers I had...the problem is the Attack Speed. For some reason my Ghoul attacks a lot faster then it should and i don't quite know why.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nIndaril",
