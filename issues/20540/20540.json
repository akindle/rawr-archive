    "Description": "While I understand that Partially Cata Ready means we should not use this model for gear selection, I also feel that it is not even close and request a downgrade until a developer can be found or others have time to correct some of the deficiencies. Currently the glyphs aren't listed properly and/or are missing; spells that are part of almost all rotations are not included; gemming templates are for Pre-Cata only. Looking at Stat values (as a guideline not a measuring stick); my intelligence was only worth 0.0 when it should be my highest (by far IAW EJ). The model is so far off that it will actual say that a +20 intelligence gem is BETTER than a +40 one.\nÂ \nWith this downgrade, users should be less inclined to create issues for this model until some work is done on it but even more importantly users will not be inclined to spend time creating/setting up a toon then get frustrated due to the highly inaccurate results. Attaching file as an example for the backwards gemming recommendations.",
