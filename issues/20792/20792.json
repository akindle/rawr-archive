    "Description": "In the spell hit tooltip (in the moonkin model at least) it shows the actual rating as well as the percentage and \"XXX Rating To Cap\".\nÂ \nIn the event that the character is over cap it current shows \"0 Rating To Cap\". Could this be changed to \"XXX Rating Over Cap\"? That way we'd know at a glance how much rating we can reforge or un-gem.",
