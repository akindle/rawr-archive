    "Description": "As a warrior tank, I'm not very concerned with threat generation right now, in Wrath of the Lich King, I've never worried about it and never had problems with it, because threat gen is baked into each tanking class now.\n \nWhat I want to see is an option to sort the list of gear regardless of what the threat stats are, but with only survivability and mitigation in mind. Right now, it will only optimize or sort based on survivability, mitigation, threat, or overall. Each of those being mutually exclusive. But the tank that can take the most pounding will have the highest combined mitigation and survivability, and THAT is the gear I want to go for.\n \nThe ability to sort and optimize based on mitigation and survivability combined (no threat), would allow me to gear to be the best option for extremely high damage fights.",
