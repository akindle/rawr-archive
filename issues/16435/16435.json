    "Description": "Could the developer(s) update Rawr with the latest changes for Elemental Shaman?\n \nChange to Shamanism talent\nChange to T10 4pc bonus\n \nWithout these changes being updated, it makes Rawr pretty worthless for Elemental Shaman to use.\n \nAlso, the gemming priority for Elemental needs a rework.  Elemental Shaman should not be gemming for Int or Mp5.  Priority should be straight Spell power > Spell power/Hit > Spell power/Haste > Spell power/Crit then Spell power/Stam only to activate Meta gems.",
