      "Message": "Well, I've checked, it's showing for Healadin only indeed. (Is it explicitly filtered out for other healing models?) Healadins do judge indeed so Black Magic can proc from judgements. However, even if the judgement is refreshed every 20 seconds, that would result in the buff procing about once a minute and lasting for 10 seconds. Rawr gives the enchant almost twice as big value. Probably it accounts every spell proccing it so the proc is only limited by the ICD of 35 seconds.",
