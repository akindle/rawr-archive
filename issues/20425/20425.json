    "Description": "The 3% attack power from the Feral Druid four-piece Tier 11 set bonus is only provided when using Mangle(Cat). Except for specific times where we will be shifting between cat and bear forms, our up-time for this buff will generally be nil. The actual bear-utilized portion of the buff regards an increase to the length of Survival Instincts (which I'm not even certain is modeled). As such, Feral Tier 11 is being placed more highly than it likely should be when considering it as a four-piece set versus better itemized off-pieces.\nÂ \nThis is not character specific.",
