As it is now, I have to expand every group that appears to be selected to see if any of the subfilters are unselected.",

      "Message": "I think what you're saying is that this set of filters (iLvl and Options) are independent of the other filters.  That's true and is the desired behavior.  But the UI for them can still be phrased positively.    I'm not saying to change anything about how the filtering is done.  I just find that having to uncheck a \"disable\" checkbox is kind of a double negative: \"don't not include these items\" and gets me confused.\r\n\r\n",
