    "Description": "I recently used the optimizer for several items I had in slots, most notably my trinkets, neck piece, and cloak. But once the new content came out, I found that there were better and clicked off the green diamonds in an effort to see what was better. The trouble was that those slots only display the items that I had chosen when I ran the optimizer. How do I get the list of items available in that particular slot back?\nÂ \nI'm attaching the character in question.",

The only two things unchecked in filters are Disable BOP Crafted and Disable by Item Level.\r\n\r\nAs for further clarification, I ran the optimizer when I just had Mark of the Unyielding selected with the green diamond. Now when I try to look at the listings for neck items, even with the green diamond taken off, the only thing I see on the gear list is Mark of the Unyielding. What I'd like to have happen is to see the entire list of items for Prot Pallies back again.",
