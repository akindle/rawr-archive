    "Description": "Intellect seems to be even with careful aim, not weighed in as high as it should be; Hit also seems to be weighted far too high, or rather, does not take into account the low hit cap. it's more than just the equivalent of 1 AP, yet seems to be being weighted as such, if not less... I'm seeing a plethora of leather gear get rated up just for having a ton of hit, but mail pieces (even with full thoroughness optimizer) with a ton of int (70+), equivalent AP, agi, and stam, but only about 2/3rds or 1/2 the hit, getting ranked much lower. We don't need as much hit as most others, needing only the 8% hit cap for all our maneuvers. I've tried to find where to modify the tree's values, but sadly I guess i'm just not very proficient at navigating Rawr's GUI. Is there any chance this'll be looked into, and even if so, where can one go to modify the values appropriately?",

The Relative Stat Values chart is a *result* of calculations, not the input.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that the Hunter model's calculations are quite old, and in need of maintenance, but we have nobody actively working on it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to work on Rawr.Hunter, let me know.",
