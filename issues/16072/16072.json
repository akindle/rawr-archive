    "Description": "When I press Optimize it says I need to select the following and lists a few things that I supposedly have not checked.  When I go back to the slot charts, it says I have them enabled to be optimized.  I have read everything about Optimizing and stuff, but maybe I am missing something.  How do I fix it?",

I then go to the shoulder enchant list, see it's checked and then can optimize fine.\r\nNot been able to figure out what causes it yet :(",

I manually edited the file to remove those references and the file then loaded alright. However, I was unable to reproduce your issue, it looks like it may have been fixed by some of the optimizer work Kavan has been doing.\r\n\r\nShockg.xml: This file loaded fine, but there were no profession related enchants selected, in fact, no enchants were marked as available to the optimizer... so I'm not sure what this file was supposed to prove. I changed the Wrist enchant to Fur Lining - AP and it ran as expected.",
