    "Description": "I ran Optimizer from Rawr 2.1.7 and after it finished the optimization the model had equipped 3xSolid Dragon's Eye + 1xDelicate Dragon's Eye, making it 4 equipped Jewelers Gem at the same time. As far as I know we are still limited to max 3 prismatic gems equipped at the same time.\nÂ \nI re-ran the optimization and next time the result had 6 prismatic gems equipped.",
