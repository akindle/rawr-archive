    "Description": "While playing around with Warlock talents I noticed that neither Pyroclasm nor Backdraft talents have any effect on DPS. Also Warlock haste appears to not factor properly into dps calculations either. When comparing similar items that have the same amount  of crit on one item and haste on the other Rawr always seems to rate the crit item higher than the haste item, even though haste is almost always a better stat than crit for destructon warlocks. The spell haste proc for Embrace of the Spider also appears to not be functioning.",

When I try to use the optimizer or to build an upgrade list I get an error: \"Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.
