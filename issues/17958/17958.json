    "Description": "hey, I just noticed that while Glyph of Starfall and Glyph of Focus are available to glyph, when you have only two glyphs selected, dps actually goes down when you select glyph of starfall, instead of going up. i just wondered what was up with that.... seems kinda screwy, was also wondering if you could include starfall into the dps rotation or make an option for it, and tie in the two glyphs so we can see if its viable or the numbers at least. ty",

      "Message": "Glyph of Starfall: Reduces the cooldown of your Starfall ability by 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nI should note that Starfall is also extremely expensive as a spell.  While most high-end Moonkin don't have mana problems, I know my own laserchicken had some mana issues when first gearing up, and the Glyph of Starfall would've resulted in me going OOM during most fights.  I suspect this is likely the issue (make sure you have all appropriate buffs selected).  Starfall is automatically included in the DPS rotation if you have it in your talent tree, and you can see the Glyph of Starfall and Glyph of Focus in the Glyphs chart; I didn't put the damage information for trees/Starfall in the UI display.  If that's what you're asking for in that last part, I can do that.",
