    "Description": "It would be nice if there was an addon to work with Rawr. Even if the addon couldn't do any calculations, it would be nice if it could scan your inventory and bank for alternate gear you have, and save that info to a file. And then the website or Rawr .exe could read that file and determine the best combination of gear. This sort of thing seems like a very feasible way to get some desperately desired in-game use from rawr.\nÂ \nAnother suggestion is an option to scan gear you have to determine possible upgrades. For example, if you have a piece of gear that drops in ToC25 normal, it will also consider other pieces from there as potential sources of gear, but it wouldn't consider a piece of ToC25 heroic gear unless you got a piece from there (or at least have the corresponding achievement perhaps).",
