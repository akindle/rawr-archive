    "Description": "Description: Some of us plan characters out in Rawr before making them in the game. This gives us the freedom of race selection. Others may be planning on paying for a race change with the new service and want to quickly see how race will affect them.\nÂ \nSuggestion: Remodel the Race drop down menu to include an additional column that short-hands the racial bonuses. Perhaps a custom control could be developed, where the 2nd column includes icons to represent all of the racial bonuses that once moused over display a tooltip with a full description of the bonus.",
