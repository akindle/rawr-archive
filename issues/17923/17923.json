    "Description": "I know it may be a moot point, but for completeness sake, I'd like to request that the trinket item Death Knight's Anguish be modeled proper.  Currently, Rawr 2 and 3 only see the passive bonus 31 Crit rating, and not it's special trigger \"Chance on melee or ranged attack to enter Wracking Pains, during which your attacks will each grant 15 crit rating, stacking up to 10 times.  Expires after 20 sec.\"",
