    "Description": "This is concerning the warrior model.  Ok, i posted a issue before about a 245 item being higher than the 258 item on the dps scale, and i have found where the issue lies.  I can pull up my character, and go to the trinket page, and at one time the correct items are showing the dps they are suppose to, and then i'll click trinket again and the order will change.  Here is an example.  I'm on the trinket 2 list.  It is showing Death's Choice 245 as my second bis with my gear, and Deaths Choice 258 as my THIRD bis with my gear.  I go up to the drop down menu and click trinket 2 again, and it will actually change and Whispering fanged skull 251 will be my bis, and Deaths choice 245 will be my third.  Then i can go and click trinket 2 page again, and their order will once again change.  Not sure why this is happening, but i can now replicate the error. So there must be an issue.",
