    "Description": "The stat scrolls conflict with the regular class buffs on live servers, but agi, strength and protection scrolls still work with SoE totem and GotW in Rawr (adding conflicting buff sections should solve it).\nI guess it would also make sense to move them to their respective categories instead of having them below all the other buffs, all alone.",

There also doesn't seem to be a lockout effective when you select a particular scroll. Only one scroll can be used on a player at a time. If another is used it overwrites what was there.",
