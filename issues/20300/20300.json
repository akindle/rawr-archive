    "Description": "I used optimizer tonight - it's telling me that I need a bunch of gear reforged to hit.  My in-game stats tell me that i have 884 hit rating (.64% to miss).\n \nRawr is telling me that I have 884 hit rating, but 8.x% chance to miss, and that I need another 850+ hit rating to cap.  \n \nThat can't be correct.\n \nI cannot get accurrate optimze info when rawr isn't calculating hit correctly.  Am I missing something?",
