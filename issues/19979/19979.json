    "Description": "Hello Guys, hi EvanM,\n \nI recognized that a trigger for trinkets with effects which pulls you under 35% health is added to Rawr. For the tanktrinkets in the ProtWarrior Model this effects are not added to the trinkets. Especially the Symbiotic Worm and I think the Bedrock Talisman would be very interesting at this point.\n \nIs it possible for you to add this effects with the new trigger to the items?\n \nAnd let me say:\nThank you very much for all the hard work which you spend for this model.\n \nAdditional Information:\nUsed Rawr Version: Rawr 4.0.19 Beta",
