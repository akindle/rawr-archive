    "Description": "Deadly Poison damage is exceptionally high in Rawr 2.3.12. Loading my guildie's rogue (see attachment), Rawr reports her DP damage as a whopping 21% of total damage. In any log you can see it should be more like 5%.\nÂ \nThe formula seems to be wrong. In CalculationsRogue, dPDamageRaw is calculated as the total damage a single application of DP deals over time. RogueRotationCalculator simply multiplies that number my the amount of expected ticks, which is wrong. Damage needs to be divided by four somewhere (12 seconds of 3-second ticks).",
