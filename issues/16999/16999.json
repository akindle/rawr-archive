    "Description": "I am able to load most of characters from armory with no hassle.\nHowever, I cannot load the character \"Banut\" on \"Mal'Ganis US\"\nI am concerned it may be due to the fact that i'm wearing the Strength ring from ICC and also have Shadow's Edge.\nI have tried Rawr 2, Rawr 3 (offline and online) and get the same results with both.\nI have tried it on two non-identical systems. I even formatted my hard drive, and went from XP to Vista to try, and it still crashes when I load from armory when it hits the \"Parsing Character Data\" step.\nI have cleared item cache, used the windows cleanup tool to wipe out silverlight and reinstall it. Iv'e made sure iv'e got .NET updated, and all windows updates are current.\nCurrently our battlegroup is bugged and you will not be able to pull up the character in armory, however this has been happening prior to this issue.",

I'm not sure exactly when this happens, but it seems to be related with items still loading at which point MainHand.Item.Speed is 0.",
