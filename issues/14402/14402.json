    "Description": "Since my saved dps warrior profile from 2.2.19 would error out when I tried to load it (into 2.2.21), I decided to start the toon profile over.\n \nLoaded profile from the armory, and started again selecting my various gear as available to the optimizer. Having leather and mail pieces available, I checked their checkboxes under \"Refine Types of Items Listed\" so I could have those items available for selection. While the leather gear appeared in the Comparions pane fine, the mail gear, however, does not show.\n \nI've tried saving, reloading, checking/unchecking the boxes with no success. Turning off leather and plate filters, aside from equipped gear, all that's listed is a few under il200 pieces and the crafted Icy Scale il213 set.\n \nEdit: As I've just discovered, due to the other similar issue posted, mail armor nearly entirely does not appear due to the single filter of \"Hide Spell Gear\" under Options > Misc.",
