    "Description": "There seems to be something funky going on with the Shaman talent, Reverbation.\n \nWhenever I put points into this talent, the dps value of several Enhancement glyphs drop significantly. I haven't seen this 'bug' reported so I thought I would notify the Rawr developers in case there is a coding error (?).\n \nIt just seems unusual for a talent that merely reduces the CD of shocks to have any impact on the dps of Windfury.\n \nThanks in advance for reading this.",

      "Message": "Reverb affects the timing of the Shock CDs as such it means that a shock becomes available earlier than it would have done which means you can get more shocks in during the combat cycle - of course this also means that you get less of something else. There are complex interactions at work with timings and GCDs etc. All this means that for instance your SS might no longer be using quite as many WF CDs as it did before, (possible I'm guessing).\r\n\r\nThe problem is you posted a discussion not an issue and you didn't post your XML file so that I could investigate if there was an issue so that I could fix it. If you could please add your XML file to this issue I can track the problem down and see if anything needs fixed.",

However its all part of the issue of smoothing of the priority options routine.\r\n\r\nI've added some new code that allows you to select a sim length and it simulates over more than one fight (smoothing out the result) at the expense of taking longer. However I really need to get some guidance from the other developers on any tricks and tips they can suggest for smoothing out the model.",
