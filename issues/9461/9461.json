      "Message": "The extra code required to do this would be rather high, would be frought with compatability issues as different versions of the very wide array of that sort of addons are released, and wouldn't necessarily be complete (no enchants or gems in some cases). Much easier and more reliable to just switch sets, relog, and hit the armory.",
