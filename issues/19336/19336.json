    "Description": "I'm not sure why my last one was closed saying it was a duplicate, but it wasn't.  I read through the one that was linked as a duplicate, and unless I honestly missed it, I don't see how it was related to my previous post.  My issue has been with Cata items specifically Ilvl 346 (from Magatha Silverton, Alliance Justice Point vendor), and I haven't Race Changed, haven't messed with the default options on Rawr. I'll give a quick example, this particular item is \"Tunic of Sinking Envy\" (http://www.wowhead.com/item=58131) The item is in the cache, but I cannot equip it, because it is not shown. I have a Night Elf Druid Cat, always have. I go and type it in to check the cache, and it is there, however if i type it in the find under chest and the bar turns red.  Everything is set right as far as my toon's information put in.  This is not an older item.  It is also the newest beta version. ** I've tried more of the gear from this vendor, and once again the items are in the cache, but you cannot select them to equip, because they are not shown in the listing for each slot.",
