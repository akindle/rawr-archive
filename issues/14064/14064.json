    "Description": "I have tried several things to get the attached error to go away. The non-descript error message didn't help - but I found out, that the error goes away, when I don't put the program on a network mounted folder. Same problem applies, if the XML-Characterfiles are stored on the net. \nÂ \nPlease add some more descript error message so noone else gets the same problem.",
