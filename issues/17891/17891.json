    "Description": "I just have a few questions for the community.  \nÂ \nIs there a character export addon different than the rpgo one? for some reason whenever i import the character into Rawr it locks all the items and i have to go through all 15 categories and unlock them.\nIs there a command to set anything i import as available?\nIn my shadow priest i have yet to enchant my legs so when i try to optimize it it gives me an error... i got back to the main character sheet and choose the enchant then hit the optimization again and it is the same error.",
