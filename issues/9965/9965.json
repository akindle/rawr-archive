    "Description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Set firefox to be your default browser. \n2. Open a browser window. \n3. Go into task manager and end the firefox process (not the application). \n4. Attempt to use Rawr to open any item in wowhead.\n \nRawr seems to be trying to open the page but gets hung up when Firefox throws in the dialog for either restoring or starting a new session. If you hit continue in the exception window and choose either option for the Firefox dialog, the wowhead window will load as expected. (Found this randomly while trying to deal with a system freeze).\n \nFirefox 2.0.0.13 as default browser, Windows XP Pro SP2, Rawr b13.1",
