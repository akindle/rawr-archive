      "Message": "Same problem happens to me. I was using rawr V2.2.19 without any problem. Then for some virus issues i was forced to format the hole harddrive and reinstall windows XP 32bits on my Pentium 4 3.0Ghz and 1Gb ram. After the reinstall and all the upgrades necessary for windows i tried to run Rawr V2.3.4 and it freezes when i close the Did you know window, and that is as far as i can get. Tried V2.2.19, it freezes less than later versions, but is to hard to work with it since it is a very old versions. ",

Is Rawr allowed to access the internet or has your AV program or Firewall blocked it?\r\n\r\nThe behaviour you are seeing is very typical of a Rawr install that cannot reach the internet to check for new versions etc.",
