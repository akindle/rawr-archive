    "ClosedComment": "Closed because this is basically the same issue as reported in ticket 15705 &#40;i.e. incorrect spell values&#41;. This has been fixed for the upcoming version.You dont see anything on the events tab because its not hooked up to the combat simulator, so thats why its blank. The simulation is still working fine tho - if you try different rotations, you&#39;ll see the item comparison values change accordingly.In a nutshell - the simulation works fine, you just wont see any Events or correct spell values until the next version.",
