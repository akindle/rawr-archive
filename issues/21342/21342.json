    "Description": "When I have all Armor Tokens un-checked, gear pieces requiring them for purchase still show up in the lists (e.g., Obsidian Arborweave Headpiece). In experimenting with un-checking and re-checking filters one at a time, I can see that these gear items are linked to the Valor and Justice Point filters instead. Makes for an unnecessarily cumbersome list when I'm trying to gear up pre-raid!",

This was what was making the pieces requiring armor tokens show up when points were selected. (Incidentally, I had Tier 12 Raid Firelands un-checked as well as Armor Tokens, and the pieces were still showing up.)",
