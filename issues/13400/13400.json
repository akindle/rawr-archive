    "Description": "I have attached a jpg image showing the issue I am having with teh Start Page.  The clickable links extend beyond their boundaries.  The tab section is repeated.  The Title is repeated again at the bottom of the page.  I am also having boundary issues on other pages as well.  At first I thought it was an issue with my .net framework installation.  I have uninstalled and then reinstalled all needed versions and patches to no avail.  Has anyone else seen this issue?\nÂ \nThanks!\n~MattS",
