    "Description": "I switched my professions and the optimizer still tell me to switch my glove enchant to hyperspeed acelerator.\n \nNVM the picture, the prior bug was something else I found. I noticed that if you don't pick the \"epic\" gem filters and pick the jewelcrafting one, the optimizer will give you the warning on your current equipped dragon's eye and nightmare tear... which is also a bug since I have selected the jewelcrafting template, but didn't want epic gems because the gear is not worth using those.\n \nKeep up the good work.",
