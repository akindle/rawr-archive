    "Description": "I'm really not sure if its just something i messed up (likely) or if there is a real problem, so i figured this is the place place to find out. I do apologize for opening a ticket if this is something that won't work due to it not being fully released yet, but frankly i'm just not sure what is related to that or not at this point. \n \nI've added a copy of my xml file so you can see for yourself, but anytime i try to optimize with that character the dps literally stays at 0. The result is 0 for existing gear and new gear. Like i said, hopefully its just something stupid i am doing that I'm unaware of and someone can point me in the right direction. \n \nThanks",
