    "Description": "Hi there, I've been using Rawr since it was just for bears so I thought I was pretty clued up with how to use it but I'm having real trouble with the mage T11 helm and fire spec. With 3 other tier 11 pieces equipped the helm (ilvl 359 though 372 version is below where I would expect as well) is way down the list (below even a 346 blue with spirit/haste for e.g.) and the optimiser is saying not to equip it, yet  when I manually equip it it jumps to second place behind only the 372 T11 helm with a vastly increased DPS value (~900dps ahead of Sinestra head in 3rd place). I unequip it and it drops back down again. The shoulders while rated fairly highly also shoot up in dps value when actually equipped so is Rawr not predicting the 4 piece bonus will be given before it is given (hope that makes sense :)\n \nIn short, is the 4 piece bonus working correctly on item list before 4 pices are equipped and in the optimiser and why are the T11 helms rated so low (maybe it isn't amazing but should it be below Mask of New Snow)?\n \nI am using the online version of rawr, have tried resetting the item cache and have also manually checked the stat values for the helm and cannot see where the discrepancy lies. Hopefully, I have attached the offending character file as well.\n \nFake edit : After typing all this out I had a quick play and part of it seems to be related to the Prime glyphs. I loaded the standard fire spec with no glyphs and the helm was listed roughly where I expected it to be but when I started ticking glyphs (Molten Armour and Fireball) it dropped way down the list (or rather everything else increased by a much greater dps value leaving it behind). With no glyphs there was still a large discrepancy in dps values between the 4th piece when it was equipped and when it wasn't.",

      "Message": "The underlying reason for this problem is that you're near a breakpoint where with more haste you'd need to use Evocation, but incremental optimization assumption doesn't allow this. Either disable incremental optimization in advanced options or (preffered) disable segment mana if you're only working with fire spec. I think in the future versions I'll change things so that this assumption only applies to arcane spec.",

Are there any downsides or things I need to be aware of now that it is disabled (other than switching it back on if I look at arcane specs)?",

      "Message": "There shouldn't be any downside for Fire spec if you disable mana segmentation. What mana segmentation mainly does is to ensure that times between consecutive evocations respect the cooldown and max/min mana constraints within each such segment. In Fire those can be in general ignored without any effect on quality of solutions.",
