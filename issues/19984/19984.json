    "Description": "Unable to have a flask Mixology buff selected as well as a double potion trick buff at the same time. Double potion trick will remove the Mixology buff and the Mixology buff refuses to be activated while there is a double potion trick buff selected. This only applies to flasks; it does not apply to elixirs.\nÂ \n(No file attached as this is not character-specific.)",
