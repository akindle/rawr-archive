    "Description": "Ive been using the web version for some time now and are very happy with it, but as of yesterday it wont appear, cant even get silverlight options open or anything. Ive reinstalled silverlight several times, and still the same result.\n \nWhen i inspect the page load, i found this error:\n \nUncaught Error: Unhandled Error in Rawr \nCode: 2103    \nCategory: InitializeError       \nMessage: 2103 An error has occurred.     \n /rawr.php/:107\nonSilverlightError\n \nCant figure out if the error is on my side or server side.\nIve tried both in Windows7 and OSX 10.7.4, and tried in Safari, Firefox and Chrome but none of them work.\nAnyone have the same problem?",
