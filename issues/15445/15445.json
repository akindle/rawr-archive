    "Description": "I have just purchased this item (Mark of Supremacy) from the vendor in Dalaran. As you can see here http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47734 it has also a \"Use: Increases attack power by 1024 for 20 sec. (2 Min Cooldown)\". This last part does not appear in Rawr even if I refresh item info several times.\nPlease fix it as it's the best trinket you can buy for a Mage.\nAlso I noticed the parsing problem when reloading items ... but I see it's already scheduled into a new release. \nGreat work, guys, keep it up! Your tool is the best!",
