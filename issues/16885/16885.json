    "Description": "I've just started playing around with Rawr, and have alot of digging around yet to do. I'm guessing that Rawr is meant for those who have already hit level 80. If however, I could add a filter for those of us who are close but haven't quite hit the level cap yet. (I'm 77). I like being able to see what equipment I have to look forward to, but it would also be nice to be able to quickly narrow it down to those I can use now. Awesome software!",
