However, I can no longer see the curren score if I pick one of the other tabs to make changes.\nÂ \nSuggestion: Show the Score at the end of the Command Line so it's always visible.  Or modify Rawr to show the \"Score\" much more prominently outside the tabbed dialog -- maybe in a larger font as well.",
