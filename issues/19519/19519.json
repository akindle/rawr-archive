    "Description": "An issue which may be specific to the Silverlight version (don't ever remember it in the past) is that tooltips seem to disappear very quickly now. \nÂ \nUnfortunatly, a lot of models use tooltips--especially on the character pane--for displaying large amounts of information. e.g. in the Mage model showing the entire rotation breakdown. It makes it pretty hard to read any of this information with the tooltips only showing up for a few seconds, and I can imagine it's a bit annoying to novice users. Not sure if anything can be done about it or if it is just system behaviour.",
