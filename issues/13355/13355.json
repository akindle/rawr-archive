    "Description": "In the Comparisons window, if I select Slot: Gems, then type of Normal it displays the Normal Gem list as usual. If I then select type Meta, and switch back to type Normal (while changing nothing at all in Rawr) it now displays a completely reordered list of Normal Gems for me. I can keep doing this and every time it will show me a wholly different order to the Normal Gems.\n \nThe gem order is very wrong usually too... like 27 Agility > 27 Strength. My favorite ordering that was completely wrong I took a screenshot of... apparently 8 Agi / 8 Crit is now the best in slot gem for DPS DKs.... LOL. Sorry had to laugh at that one.\n \n*Added* - This also happens for Meta Gems. The order changes completely when I reselect to look at them.",

This does not seem to happen if you start up Rawr and immediately look at gem, but the moment you start loading information from the armory, or existing Rawr profiles, the gems start getting strange values.",

I hope that we can get this fixed, as it is definitely preventing me from using Rawr effectively for my DK right now; back to excel spreadsheets/etc right now and my brain begs for relief.
