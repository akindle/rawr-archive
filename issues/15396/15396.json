    "Description": "Currently I make a lot of use of the \"Build Upgrade List\" as it gives a very different indication of what is an upgrade compared to the comparison panes - especially +hit pieces as my toon is usually at the cap so the +hit appears worthless in the pane.\nÂ \nWhat would be nice though would be a similar feature for a slot.   For something like trying to work out the best trinkets for my gear I need to basically set the filters to show all gear, then run a \"build upgrade list\" which is amazingly slow when you have that much gear selected. It would be great to be able to do something like \"Build Upgrade List for Helms\" or similar that ignored items from all other slots and just did the helms.",

      "Message": "I like this.  Another great option would be \"build upgrade list for tier\".  I don't know how much of this functionality would be covered by the new \"item cost\" system, and I know it could be easily manipulated to create such functionality, but allowing a narrowing based on a few large \"classes\" of gear (outside of and separate from the typical item filter restrictions), such as Build Upgrade List for:  All, Slot:[Head], or Tier:[10] would be valuable.  These would still all respect the pre-existing Item Filters when run, of course.",

      "Message": "Particularly if you are doing all slots, it would be beneficial if you have more control over item type filters.   Some of the models have them already, but being able to filter out all spellpower items in the melee classes (except pally/shaman) would greatly reduce the number of items that the optimiser needs to look at.  Similarly, casters being able to filter out all AP items.\r\n\r\n",
