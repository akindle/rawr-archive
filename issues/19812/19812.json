    "Description": "This is from a Human DK and its not only for the parry/dodge as i noticed stat that are off, not by much in most case but there is still a small difference.\nAll those stat are seen from in-game vs rawr and with only 1 buff on me being blood presence.\nAlso if it could have any impact this is using the wpf version.\n \nstam     in-game 7542      rawr 7323\nAP        in-game 7007      rawr  7520\nexp       in-game 20         rawr 21\narmor   in-game 29883    rawr 28698\nhealth   in-game 148613  rawr 145287 thought if i mouse over the health in rawr it says 148919\ndodge  in-game 11.32     rawr 10.49\nparry    in game 12.48     rawr 14.63\n \neven the armor dmg reduction is off and by alot  in-game 53.41   rawr 46.84  and i did lower my armor by 1149 bringing me close to the rawr armor value but that only lowered the dmg reduction to 52.43\n \non a different topic any plans to add the sundr/faerie fire/expose armor/pet debuff to both the tank/dps dk models as it is missing from the buff/debuf list",

It's not specific to DKs.\r\n\r\nDebugging notes For my DK w/ my latest dev build.:\r\nParryRating is off by 52 with gear. \r\nParry is off by ~2% + the .06% level difference modifier after taking ParryRating differences into account.\r\nDodge & Dodge rating is correct. But then it's wrong since it's not taking the .06% level difference modifier.",
