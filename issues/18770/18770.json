    "Description": "With the attached character (my hunter) run a build upgrade list (just using the loot from heroic 25man Gunship) and the Scourgeborne Waraxe shows up as an upgrade (I have no other 1H marked available so it is a bit strange it is showing up at all).     \nÂ \nIn the tooltip of the Upgrade List (where it shows all the gear/enchants/gems to make it an upgrade), it still shows his current 2H weapon (Distant Land).   I'm not sure if this is just a tooltip error or if the 2Hers stats are being calculated in the results.",

That gearset includes the 2H weapon which obviously shouldn't be there as you would be equipping the 1H axe.  \r\n\r\n",
