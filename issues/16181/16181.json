    "Description": "The first time I go to the optimizer after opening my character (with JC/Tailoring, which is known by Rawr) it prompts me that my cloak and pants enchants aren't available. To fix this I have to manually select Tailoring as my profession.\nI'm not sure whether it has issue with my JC gems, since after manually selecting tailoring it completes it properly with JC gems, though manually selecting Tailoring could be \"corrupting\" the process with regards to JC.",

      "Message": "Notes from processing your issue:\r\n* Used your char name at server Kirin Tor on a Load from Armory and optimize immediately ran with no issues.\r\n* Loaded your file and on optimize it gave an alert for failure to mark a Meta Gem available. However this is due to my having turned off gems in templates being auto-avail to optimizer. Turned that option back on and it ran as expected, no alerts.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Redownload Rawr and load your char from the armory then mark your extra gear manually as there could be a corruption in either your local copy of the exe or in your xml file that we don't see.\r\n\r\nSide-Note: You have 8 different Helms marked (and now that I'm looking, you have a ton of items in almost every slot), some of which are lesser versions of themselves (Sunstrider's Hood of Triumph and Conquest are both marked). There is no reason to do that as you will never wear the lesser versions again, take the extra ones out as they are hampering your ability to optimize.",
