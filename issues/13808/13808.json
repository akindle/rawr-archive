I'm rooting them out, but there's some specific objects (around 10% for me) where the null instances start creeping in.  Might be middle of the weekend before I have a fix.  \r\n\r\nI know this doesn't happen w/ DPS DK so I know there's also something I should be tweaking in my module code as well as hardening the optimizer code.",
