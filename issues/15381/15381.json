    "Description": "Loading my resto druid (Teors@Jubei'Thos) into 2.3.2, it reports that:\n \nHealBurst = -122.9695\nHealSustained = -5358.782\n \nGiven that my healing isn't actually damaging players, I'm assuming there's something not quite right with the calculations... though looking at the new options, presumably this is a consequence: the defaults (which I haven't changed) are:\n \nSingle Target Max Healing Target: 9000 hps\nSustained Healing Target: 8500 hps\n \nMy gear clearly isn't up to that; perhaps a better indication of being to unable to meet the targets would be better than reporting a negative result of the simulation. Also, perhaps reasonable defaults would be better, though these targets are obviously going to scale up based upon the difficulty of the content. The raid healing I've sent (ToTC-10/25 normal modes) tends to be around 2-5K hps (average for a given encounter).",

      "Message": "HealSustained and HealBurst are values that indicate whether you're behind or ahead of your target. I should have clarified this on that tab, I think. A negative value means you are short of your target. A positive value means you're ahead of your target. If you use the sliders to make both values match eachother, then you indicate that the current balance between burst and sustained is OK with you. If you manage to get them such that both values are 0 then you reached the current estimated HPS by the model.\r\n\r\nYes, your raid healing is usually much less. In \"real\" situations you have lag and lots of overhealing and all those tiny mistakes (such has HOT clipping) that make it go down. We're talking about theoretical hps here :)\r\n\r\nI hope these answers satisfy your query. If not, just reply.",
