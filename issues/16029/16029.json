    "Description": "Not sure if this is just related to the Elemental module or not, but was looking over some upgrades and the gems I'd need for them and noticed Rawr wants me to use Royal Dreadstone (12sp/5mp5) in blue sockets to match my meta. I figured ok, I might be going OOM and need the mp5, but I was looking over gems and noticed the information for some gems aren't correct. Gems like Mysterious Dreadstone, Glowing Dreadstone, Tenuous Dreadstone, and Infused Dreadstone are only showing one stat. If you edit the item to set the other stat, they are correct. Also noticed several of the Ametrine gems were like that as well. I've checked my filters and all gems are checked, and I've updated the item cache from both wowhead and the armory, as well as trying to update the gems by themselves from both locations.",
