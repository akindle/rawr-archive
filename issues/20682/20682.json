    "Description": "I heard it should be disabled by default but I noticed it listed [checked] in the buffs tab's list when importing from battle.net.\n \nIt's not technically a bug but intuitively it seems wrong since getting focus magic is rare and it's even weak on arcane mages if I'm not mistaken.\n \n[the character I had noticed it is http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/lightnings-blade/fateswarm/advanced]\n \nedit: oops, I had forgotten to add it's on an arcane mage importation but I guess that's sorted now since the bug is accepted as fixed.",
