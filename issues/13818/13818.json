    "Description": "The DPSDK currently has a few errors with the talent comparison chart when managed RP is enabled that, depending on spec, will result in a divide by zero error. There are also some talents that again, depending on spec, will have negative value, which decrease the readability of the chart. Disabling managed RP will allow the talent comparison to work, but with reduced functionality; all source of talent-based RP generation will be unvalued.",
