    "Description": "First of all thank you for fixing the supression issue so that hit is calculated correctly. I do see quite a bit of progress with the haste issues as well as gear choices Rawr is picking are more logical based on scaling, etc.\n \nCouple of things I noticed...\n \n1. There are 2 fields to pick glyphs... one of which does NOT effect dps (under options, glyphs). The other one does effect dps (talents, glyphs). This is a little confusing.\n \n2. The glyph of incinerate, immolate, and life tap all seem to give a boost in dps. Conflagrate actually causes DPS to go DOWN, which doesn't make sense. Chaos Bolt does nothing (again, should give a boost). Imp does nothing either (shout boost dps with imp pet).\n \nOtherwise thanks for the work and I look forward to more improvments.",
