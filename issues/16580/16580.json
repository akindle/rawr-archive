    "Description": "regarding to my posts on http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=197903\nÂ \nIn german language the mouse over tool tip of the T10 set items doesnt shows the cost of the T10 set. E.g. item=50396 \"Mantelung des purpurroten Akolyten\".\nError message \"drops from unknown boss in icecrwon...wowhead lacks data\" Its all the same, if i refresh from wowhead or armory.\nBut if i switch to english language it works and it shows \"purchasable with 60[ Emblem of Frost]\".\nBut if i right click and edit the item, the item has still a zero Cost value (bottom center of the window). And its not available for the cost optimizer.\nSo i have to type in manually in the bottom center of the window the correct cost value.",
