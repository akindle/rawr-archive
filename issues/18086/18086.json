    "Description": "I have seen a few comments regarding the slowness of the optimizer along with the arp difference from the last version and someone has stated fixed, this can only be possibly for the arp as the optimizer is still unusually slow.  I have been experiencing 40 min + wait times compared to 8 min on full using the optimizer between the newest version of rawr and its previous.  Now this must be something directly with the fury warrior as when i do exactly the same with prot build i do not suffer any issues what so ever.\n \nI have tried using the same file to do both specs and have tried fresh specs and new install of rawr nothing makes a difference, you know when you are experiencing the problem as doing simple things such as enabling buffs or changing drop down menu from say head to chest can take load times unlike before also.\n \nsorry if somewhere you say you are working on these things, im new to actually the posting service/forums as i never had a issue before with this great prog so never had to do much research.",

I'm using Rawr v2.3.22 and I've actually seen a boost in ProtWarr optimization (at least that's my perception) but none into DPSWarr.  For example, it takes 15 minutes to build the upgrade list for my ProtWarr ... for my DPSWarr I had it running for 4 days ! and the worst of it all was that in the end it produced a blank list ... talk about frustrating.  PLease take a look into it as it has become really frustrating using Rawr for DPSWarr optimization.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
