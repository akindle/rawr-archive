    "Description": "From Discussions as requested. I could never get .15 to work for me, so none of my saves were with it. I'm pretty sure the attached file was saved with .13, as I hadn't updated for a few weeks and went from .13 to .15 before .16\n \nThis is one of a number of files, all of which fail.\nI don't seem to be able to load any previously saved configurations - it stalls at 0 of 3 tasks completed and the green progress bar stops at circa 3-4%.\n \nWindows task manager indicates that Rawr is not responding and the process shows it taking a constant 25% CPU cycle time.\n \nI've left it for about 10 minutes, but it seems that it will not progress any further.",
