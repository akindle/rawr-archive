And what do ya know there's an upgrade, I click to view the item on wowhead, and its's heroic mode only! great that is exactly what I did not want to see.\nÂ \nthanks for the hard work so far :) enjoy the issue reports!",

Now that the game is out for a month now, HOPEFULLY Wowhead has corrected a lot of their mistakes in the dungeon drops.  Also you can easily update the item from wowhead by clicking it in the graph window and say \"Update from Wowhead.\" If you know the item id of the item, go into the edit item window and click the add button. Enter in the item id, and the item will be updated with whatever is posted on wowhead.",
