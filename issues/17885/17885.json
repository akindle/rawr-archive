    "Description": "I've noticed in case like Boomkin/Resto, Shadow/Heals & Elemental/Resto that the stats on the pieces are very similar and it can often be difficult to tell which pieces is which. Is there a way you could add something like (resto) in brackets or something in the tooltips? I know this is probably not easily possible as it would involve the parsing of Wowhead/Armory data but it would be useful if it is possible.\nÂ \nAnother option would be showing the set bonus effect (grayed out if inactive) like \"rejuv crit multiplier\" as it appears in the Buffs->Set Bonuses tab",

If i'm at work then I look up the item in Wowhead.    \r\n\r\nEasily worked around, but something that would be quicker and more convenient in the Rawr tooltip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I hadn't realised there was a method to the naming as I usually don't pay much attention to the set name, just the set bonuses to see which is which.\r\n\r\nI'll start paying more attention and get used to it.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving set that, it would be nice to have the set name in the tooltip instead of having to go into the edit item screen to see it. :)\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "Yes, this would be a nice feature, something along the lines of what is in-game already when you slew over a set piece of gear. I assume Rawr already has some of this coded into the models since it effects 2pc and 4pc buffs. Not sure if \"Part of set X\" is part of the parsing data but some sort of tooltip info would be nice. Even better would be a tooltip showing what you have equip or not again like it does in-game.\r\nI realize the developers already invest a lot of time/effort just maintaining Rawr2/3 but I feel this would help many Rawr users in understanding sets and why set peices are often ranked higher than where they would expect it to be.",
