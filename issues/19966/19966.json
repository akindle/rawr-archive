    "Description": "The latest version has now prioritized dodge ahead of agility (I'm at the soft health cap). The agility drop could be partially explained by the drop in bear damage, but it seems overdone at about a 50% absolute drop. I noted also that mastery is not showing up in the RSV list so perhaps something is broken in the Savage Defense calculations that is causing this.",
