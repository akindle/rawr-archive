      "Message": "Loading the file, it looks like the default cache doesn't have mastery on that cloak, which is why it would suggest Crit -> Mastery reforging. Adding the stat onto the item stops that. I will have Hina upload an updated cache that has Mastery on that item\r\n\r\nLooking at the Metas now",

Gemming templates generator now creates template sets for Fleet, Chaotic and Agile metas (instead of just Fleet).\r\n\r\nAlso, your character file doesn't have its Glyphs set, please be sure to set them so your calculations are more accurate.",
