    "Description": "In the attached file different values on the Resourcefulness gives.\nTalent / dps / \"frequency\" of black arrow. \n0 -> 8127 dps / 32.71\n1 -> 8197 dps / 29.98\n2 -> 8100 dps / 27.71\n3 -> 8178 dps / 27.72\n \nI'm trying to figure out if this can be a similar effect due to cutoffs and fight length as with the Rapid fire talent but it is not as easy to see. If it had reached a plateau for talent 2 and given no extra dps for 3 talents then it could be explained by not having to use viper tnx to the reduced cost of Black arrow.\n \nIf it is an effect of \"bad\" luck in that loosing or gaining an extra Kill Shot or Exploding shot depending on the fight length... then the trouble becomes what guidance it leaves the user with. \"Should I or shouldn't I have 2 talent points in Resourcefulness.",
