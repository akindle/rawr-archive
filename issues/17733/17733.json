    "Description": "With all the talk of fixing the filters and parsing at the moment, particularly including the relevant T10 pieces in the VOA section AND the Frost Emblem section, I thought i'd bring up the addition of a filter for BoE items.    \nÂ \nMore for the many ICC drops than the crafted items which are already easily dealt with in the crafted section of filters.   It would make using Rawr to gear a new toon up to ICC ready much easier.",
