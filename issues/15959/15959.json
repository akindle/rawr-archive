    "Description": "I noticed while working on my bear, that Improved Demoralizing Rawr does not affect the score. So when I looked at the debuff tab, the AP reduction debuff was not shown. I know at this time Bears don't have much in the way of showing AP reduction but I do know warriors do have a way. These debuffs include\nÂ \nCurse of Weakness - 478\n  2/2 Improved - 574\nVindication - 278 (YourLevel * 3.3 + 23) * TalentPointsSpent\n  2/2 Vindication - 574\nDemoralizing Roar - 411\n  5/5 Improved - 575\nDemoralizing Shout - 411\n  5/5 Improved - 575",

      "Message": "The main reason is because there's not a lot of data on just how AP on bosses work.  We have data for Maexxna that shows that reducing her AP will reduce her damage done by a set percent, but we also know that the percentage is different on other attacks (ie, demo shout is <25% reduction on Maexxna, but is 50% on Thorim's Unbalancing Strike).  So, we are assuming that you are putting in the debuffed damage that the mob deals, not the unbuffed damage.",
