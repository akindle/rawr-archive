      "Message": "There's (obviously) really no such thing as 102.4% avoidance. 102.4% is the total you need to see on your character sheet in order to be unhittable by a boss. That's because bosses bypass 0.6% of each avoidance type. The %s you see in Rawr are real avoidance rates. Thus, you are unhittable when they total up to 100%.",

I understand why 100% makes more sense, i was just setting my rawr to 102.4 because of that guide, but now i'll set it for 100 instead, thanks\r\n\r\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f76/t110338-cataclysm_tanking_protection_field_manual_updated_feb_9_2011_4_0_6_a/",
