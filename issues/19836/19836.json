    "Description": "Currently it seems to be showing in rawr.bear as 1.4 PPM but from what I can find its generally accepted as being 1.0 PPM. Apologies if I missed a dicussion that disproved the 1.0 PPM value somewhere but as it stands Windwalk is being overrated by rawr.bear I think. Unfortunately I dont think I can edit enchants as I can items so I cant check if it would still be best MH enchant with a 1.0 PPM.\n \nI presume the other Windwalk is an older implementation (showing as 10% proc with 45 ICD)?\n \nNot a high priority thing but would like to know if its worth the cost of Windwalk over 130 agility at present (and my maths ability is slightly lackluster).",

Can't find anywhere that thinks it is anything other than 1.0PPM (which I believe is a pretty standard PPM value for enchants?). 1.4 PPM seems a very odd value for Blizzard to have used (not that Blizzard are averse to stupid values ofc). \r\n\r\nI'm certain rawr sourced its PPM value from somewhere, did you have a link to where that value was found I could take a peek at?",

      "Message": "I suspect the issue here maybe my lack of understanding of the PPM value in rawr. Although with autoattacks Windwalk may indeed have a proc chance of 1PPM (as specified in some places), presumably the PPM value in rawr actually takes into account special attacks as well? Perhaps thats why there is a difference to what I was expecting?",
