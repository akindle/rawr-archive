Wowhead comments indicate this item was never added to the game, in fact it appears to be exactly the same as item #48187, \"Runetotem's Mantle of Conquest\" except that the latter is properly labelled as Horde-only.\nÂ \n\"Runetotem's Mantle\" should probably be removed from the default item cache.",
