    "Description": "This is for Druids, Shamans, Paladins, and Priests Devs. I'm adding in two new Mana Cost reduction variables due to a new trinket that only reduce mana cost for Nature and Holy spells. The variables will be:\n \nNatureSpellsManaReduction\nHolySpellsManaReduction\n \nIf you could implement these variables as part of the mana Reduction portion of your code, that would be appreciated.",

      "Message": "Is it a flat value that needs to be directly subtracted from the spell mana cost?\r\nAny idea how it interacts with talents that reduce mana cost? Is it applied before or after multiplicative reductions? (For example Druid's Mooglow. I guess other classes have something similar somewhere.)\r\nI believe Druid heals are still considered Nature Spells?",
