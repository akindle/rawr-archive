    "Description": "When importing my character from the Armory it seems like the ProtPaladin module isn't correctly reading the item values. The health value is low by around 400 health and currently the defense is off by 4 Defense Skill. I\"m not sure if 3.2 changed some base values somewhere, but if someone can take it a look at this it would be appreciated.",

Are you also looking at your paper doll screen in WoW itself?\r\n\r\nIf things changed in 3.2, then I will get on it. \r\n\r\nThe gist though, is that Negarine and I had worked on our model to be *more* accurate than Armory, with the intention of it matching the API in-game values, rather than the oddly rounded displayed stuff in Armory and on the Character screen.",
