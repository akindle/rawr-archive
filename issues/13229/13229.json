    "Description": "There are several trinkets that are being undervalued in Elemental. Trinkets such as Scale of Fates which gives 125 SP and 432 haste for 20 Seconds on use is only being given a score of 249.05. Where-as Embrace of the spider is considered far and away on top at 503.28. The Illustration of the Dragon Soul is not even listed. So I don't know if the developer hasn't implement the new proc system into the calculations or not but it is a little disconcerting.",
