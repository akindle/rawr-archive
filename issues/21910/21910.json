    "Description": "This problem was reported months ago.  I am attaching a character file with current gear that has been optimized to over 106% CTC.  This is a major error that makes the model useless at current gear levels.  The most recent release without this error in the ProtPaladin model is 4.2.1.  The ProtPaladin model has not in recent memory recognized the worth of reaching the cap, but at least the model used to recognized the worthlessness of stacking mastery beyond the cap.  Please roll the model back until you can find someone who will maintain it.",
