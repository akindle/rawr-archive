I can't figure out a way to reproduce it 100% of the time though.",

I was also able to make this stop by disabling the Rare(jewelcrafting) template.  Similarly, I also discovered that the optimizer is NOT ready for Runed Dragon's Eye gems to be colored (RED), like patch 3.2 will bring -- really weird stuff starts happening with auto-gem choices.",

      "Message": "To go along with what tkb said, I tried setting Runed Dragon's Eye to only fit red sockets, but then the optimizer started putting Reckless Monarch Topazzes into almost all red and yellow sockets, even though Runed Scarlet Ruby was clearly still ahead in points  (Immediately after optimizing I was able to gain about another 40 overall points by simply switching each item to one with a higher-rated gemming.)",
