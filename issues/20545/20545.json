Otherwise, you have to wait until the next version is released (apply's to both Online and Downloadable versions).\r\nMarkdall, when you first load Rawr, on the Welcome Screen there is a list of the models status (as well as in the bottom right corner of the screen if you are already in the module).  Hunter (and Elemental) is listed as inoperable (or non-functional).  I believe that is sufficient warning that you shouldn't be using this module.  If you want to submit a patch (for anything), feel free, but it may not be accepted.",

I once submitted a patch that would let you copy to the clipboard a list of just the crap that had changed - as in, \"To meet what Rawr is telling you to do, go buy the following gems\". It got denied with the explanation that the Silverlight version would handle that. Guess what the Silverlight version doesn't handle. oh well.",
