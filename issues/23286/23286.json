    "Description": "When I try to load a character from the battle.net armory I get an error on both the web version and the downloadable version.  The suggested fix is to use the in game add on.  When I try to export a character with the in game add on I get an error there as well.\nÂ \nYour help system is the worst help system I have ever used.  It is completely unintuitive and unwieldy.",

Modifying Rawr for the 5.04 patch would be a massive amount of work for just a few weeks usage.  The Rawr devs are instead working on getting Rawr and the addon ready for Mists and level 90 content.\r\n",

When you say to add all this manually how do you suggest doing that when the talent system doesn't seem to par up with the way Rawr is set up?",
