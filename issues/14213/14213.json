    "Description": "It seems like Rawr is still displaying my Chaotic Skyflare Diamond as active (Requires at least 2 blue gems) even though I have all red, 2 orange, and 1 prismatic (Nightmare Tear). The meta is not active with this gem configuration. I run optimize with top gems of all colors checked and it still does not a) change to the 21 agility meta or b) add another blue gem.",
