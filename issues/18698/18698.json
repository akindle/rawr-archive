      "Message": "Wait, you can't load toons in Rawr2 either? Because that would be a completely different issue.\r\n\r\nRawr3 uses ElitistArmory.com because they have a queuing system in place for pulling characters off of the WoW Armory. We HAVE to use this queueing method because with the online version of Rawr3, all of the requests for characters for every user on the planet end up coming from the server's IP address. The WoW Armory is designed to ban IP Addresses that are sending too many requests at a time. The Queuing process, works around this by slowing down the number of requests to an allowable level. ElitistArmory.com also stored your character for you so you can just download off them instead of the wowarmory, which also cut down on requests, unless you used Force Refresh all the time.\r\n\r\nRawr2 just uses the WoW Armory because the Request comes from your system, your IP address and you can't physically perform enough requests through Rawr2 to ban yourself.\r\n\r\nSo if one isn't working, the other should be, unless BOTH websites are down OR EA doesn't have your character pre-loaded and WoWA is down.",

Just select the items your character is wearing manually. Sure it takes longer but once you save the file, you won't have to do it again. When you want to come back later and change it to the new gear you got, just do it by selecting the items, that's what the drop-downs are for.",
