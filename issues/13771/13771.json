    "Description": "Similar to not scaling with font size, but different enough to create a new issue for it.\n \nMy laptop which has a fairly low 1024x768 resolution, where the bracer and 2nd trinket tend to fall of the screen. Please either add a scrollbar, or downscale the icons if the window is smaller than what's minimally required.\n \nThanks!",
