    "Description": "The current Hunter model is listed to be based on the Elitist Jerks spreadsheet version 91a (according to comment in code \"CalculationsHunter.cs\"). In iamcals last note on (http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Rawr.Hunter&version=43) he mentions the 91e version, and I would assume that he updated the module to include changes between 91a and 91e. \n \nSpreadsheet (http://elitistjerks.com/f74/t30710-wotlk_dps_spreadsheet/) is currently in version 92a (series of releases since 91e: 91f, 91g, 92PTR, 92PTR2, 92 and 92a). Changes since 91e is listed in a change table inside the excel file. Most of the fixes listed would probably not affect the core calculations since many are updates to the internal excel listings of items. However some probably would (e.g. \"Bestial Wrath/TBW now last 10 seconds\") and some might (e.g. \"Fixed resist calculations for Hand-mounted Pyro Rocket, which lead to any +hit over 100% increasing dps\") depending on how the Rawr calculation module is built.\n \nThis would also have to be compared to the list of observed bugs that iamcal listed at the wiki page http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Rawr.Hunter&version=43.",

The only update to the Hunter Module was one that I submitted the base talent builds that Shandara's Spreadsheet uses in her 92PTR2 build.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping and know C#, give Ast a call.",
