    "Description": "Description - Items that require Trophies of the Crusade to purchase are no longer able to be filtered correctly.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Rawr v2.3.5 or v2.3.4 or v2.3.3.\n2. Select an item slot that has a item that is purchased with a Trophy of the Crusade as an upgrade/downgrade possibility.\n3. Set the filters to show only items that can be purchased with just Badges of Triumph.\n4. Observe that the items requiring a Trophy of the Crusade are still being displayed.\n \nVersion Number:  2.3.5, 2.3.4, 2.3.3  (Note: In version 2.3.2 the filtering of these items is correct.  The loss of filtering is observed post-2.3.2).\n \nAdditional Details:  Refreshing the item cache does not solve the problem.",
