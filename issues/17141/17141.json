    "Description": "The following occur when i download items from wowhead, update upgrades from wow head\ni used \"na=Wrathful\" as a filter as well as many other combination all yielded this error.\nAlso a seperate and possible related issue, when i manually add an item for example wrathful galdiator's Pendant of Victory, it will show up on the list of items but not on the list in the client when only pvp items are shown, for example only hateful is show which is odd because I am using the latest version of Rawr and there isnt even furious necks available. I'll attach the char I used.\n \nNote that these issues are severly limiting the proper use of the tool and I am stuck completely on several areas with no work-around.\n \nStep Name: ImportWowheadFilter\nDescription: Error interpreting the data returned from Wowhead\nIndex was outside the bounds of the array.\n   at Rawr.Wowhead.GetItem(String site, String query, Boolean filter)\n   at Rawr.Wowhead.ImportItemsFromWowhead(String filter, Boolean usePTR)",
