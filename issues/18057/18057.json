    "Description": "Not worried about DPS, ability damage, or whatnot, but I am experiencing a flat ArP number difference between the two versions with the same profile, showing as 1047 (99.81%) in .18 and 1103.83 (103.87%) in .19.  I did see Astry's note in the Cat thread mentioning a similar issue, but while I'm not all too concerned about the final % difference, I am worried about the flat # difference.  My only hypothesis is that the ArP being provided through multiplicative sources is somehow pushing me into the \"other\" ArP calculation bracket, but even though I don't remember the numbers for the brackets, I don't see that happening at current levels of ArP.\nÂ \nAlso, I just got back into raiding a week ago.  Don't laugh at the gear.  :P",

It was really very weird - Not only was it a display issue (when mousing over the ArP stat breakdown, it showed the correct raw amount, but it mysteriously added in some extra ArP from who-knows-where in the actual single-line-display), but it also ACTED as though there was more ArP than there really was.",
