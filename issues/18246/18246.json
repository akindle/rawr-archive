I ran a manual Evaluate Upgrade to use the Equip All function, and that said it wasn't an upgrade.

When I went into the off-hands comparison page, it showed that the 232 was worth almost nothing.   When I marked it available and optimised, it was an obvious upgrade.\r\n\r\nI checked the RSVs page and there was no unusual stats shown (negative haste or anything).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
