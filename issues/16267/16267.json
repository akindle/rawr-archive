Adding/removing points out of this talent doesn't change the DPS rating. \nI also tried remaking the same talent build, but somehow the DPS rating is a lot lower than the original one.\nÂ \nI uploaded a picture with the original and redone build.",

I'm going to re-import my char with the same properties and see what DPS rating it gives me. Could be something from a previous version..",

DPS rating drops again by ~660.\r\nSo It's either something going wrong when importing a character or when redoing the talents.\r\n\r\nBtw. should I change my issue title to this \"new\" issue?",
