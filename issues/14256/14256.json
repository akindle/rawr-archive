    "Description": "Triumphant Armor that require Trophy of the Crusade do not read the tokens right. Since it uses two tokens instead of one.\nÂ \nI started wondering and looked into the source code and was able to make show the 2nd item (attached mostly around line 340-356). The only downside is it not saving both tokens to the data. This however makes it so the Trophy filter does work as band aid type of fix... Hope this helps",
