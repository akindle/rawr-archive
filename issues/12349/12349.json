    "Description": "The Furor Talent in the Resto Tree is inadvertently giving the 10% Intellect that would normally go to Mookin form, also go to Tree Form. Without the talent, I would come up with the correct total intellect. However when I do have the talent, I would come up with 10% more. (jump from 18,536 Mana to 22,196 Mana).",
