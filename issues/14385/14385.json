    "Description": "Mace Specialization is giving very bizzare results for different ranks of the Talent. \nUsing 2 maces here are the DPS results I got when putting points into Mace Specialization:\n0/5 points: 2307 DPS\n1/5 points: 2232 DPS\n2/5 points: 2156 DPS\n3/5 points: 756 DPS ! O.o \n4/5 points: 2005 DPS\n5/5 points: 1930 DPS\nNow, I'm no math major, but seems to me adding points to Mace Specialization when using 2 maces should be a straight DPS increase, rather then decrease, against max armor mobs with no debuffs (to say nothing of what the heck's going on at 3/5 points). \nTested with multiple characters; one example attached.",

      "Message": "A couple bad things were happening.  First, it was decreasing DPS because it was modifying your target's DamageReduction by subtracting instead of adding.  Secondly, the talent was defined with 3/5 being 0.9 instead of 0.09.\r\n\r\nRegardless, none of this is using the proper armor penetration formula, but I don't have time to dig in too much right now and completely re-vamp the module.  I'm going to check in the quick fix.",
