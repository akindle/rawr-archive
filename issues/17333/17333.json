    "Description": "I have a fury DPS warrior. Gilneas Server, character name Grokl. I selected Warrior as the class and DPSWarr as the Model. None of the Fury or Arms things are adding to my DPS, so it says I have a DPS of 1376 with my current gear set because it only lists the white damage and the deep wounds I am inflicting. My talents do load correctly, so it isn't like it thinks I am untalented. This has been this way for a few versions, at least.",
