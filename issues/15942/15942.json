    "Description": "Ok, I'm not sure if this is \"Bad data\" or what. But if a cloak has \"armor\" with a variable set, it factors in the Bear armor multiplier. Only way around this is by setting the armor to \"Bonus Armor.\"\nÂ \nA good way to test this is by unselecting a cloak and then select a frost cost cloak. The value of the cloak would shoot 2k armor. But if you change the value to Bonus Armor, it changes it correctly to 700 something. I tried updating my values from both the Armor and WoWhead and it didn't change for either.",

      "Message": "Now that I think about it...Shouldn't the system be not factoring in the armor multiplier for the cloak. Without the cloak selected, it says my armor should be 34,629. If I select the Sentinel's Winter Cloak which has 177 armor and 560 Bonus Armor, it brings my total armor up to 36,427.\r\n\r\nIf you subtract the 560 Bonus Armor, that would come up to 35,867. Subtract that from the non-cloak Armor, that would make a difference of 1238. Divide that by 177, and that would be a divisible of 7 (6.994)",
