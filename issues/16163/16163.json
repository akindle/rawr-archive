    "Description": "Would it be possible to label any item with \"No Source\" that has resilience as \"PVP Item\". The number of unknown sources for PVP items is very large for some classes. Having them labeled \"PVP Item\" would make it easier to filter them and still be able to sort them as Source Unknown. Possible lable them as \"Unkown PVP Item\" or something like that.",
