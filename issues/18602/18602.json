    "Description": "If you create a new bear in the current Rawr 2 (2.3.22) and Rawr 3 (b3.0.3.22) and look at the Options tab, the numerical values associated with the \"Survival Soft Cap\" and \"Target Damage (Raw)\" drop-downs appear to be different between versions.\n \nFor example, for \"T10 Raids (25, Heroic)\" survival soft cap is 400,000 in V2, 350,000 in V3.  \"Target Damage (Raw)\" is 150,000 in V2, but 120,000 in V3.\n \nI realize that these values are best-guess guidelines, not things that come directly from the mechanics, so in that sense either of these sets of values could be \"correct\".  However, one effect of having the difference is that if your gear puts you in the range between the two values then Rawr 2 and Rawr 3 start giving different gear choice, gemming and enchanting recommendations, and I don't think that can be the intended behavior.\n \nI haven't checked all of the values across versions, but it seems to start with the T10 raids, where the Rawr 2 values are all around 50,000 higher than the Rawr 3 values.\n \nRawr 2 also has separate numbers for the Lich King vs. the other T10 fights (numbers which in the heroic mode are truly scary but from what I've seen of the it probably justifiably so).  I can't see how taking the hardest fight *out* of the equation would justify an *increased* survival value for what remains, however.",
