    "Description": "Thanks to the team for making this awesome program (particularly the shadowpriest modeller). I have noticed one problem however, (I only use this for shadowpriest so do not know if it happens with other models, or holy). I apologise if this is an issue that has already been posted. When I run the optimiser and have items selected for overall, it has a progress bar but just constantly has a value of zero, all the way till the it finishes. It takes a while for it to finish so it is doing something, but the value never changes from zero (0). Once it finishes, the below error pops up. However if I run it for DPS burst-rating, sustained rating or survival in isolation it works perfectly, and changes my suit with its recommendations. Hope this helps. My character file is attached if need be but feel free to load Nylerua from Aman'thul if need be.\n \nSee the end of this message for details on invoking \njust-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.\n \n************** Exception Text **************\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.",

      "Message": "I can confirm the optimizer not working for the [Overall] setting, for shadow priest, and holy/disc priest models. the OverallPoints property is always 0 even when there is scores for all the Subpoints. (I assume the OverallPoints should be some function of the subpoints?). This is the case for both algorithms available. Might try to debug it some more, even though I'm not familiar with the code :) I tested this behaviour for 2.1.2 and 2.1.3.",
