Yes And here I've got only the regem equiped but not the reenchant \r\n\r\n3) other issue, sometimes I don't know when I have only one trinket and one ring, the other choise have deasapered ... I can't reproduice it.",

      "Message": "1) I think he means on the options tab; there's no mouseover for those in v2.2.0b1.\r\n2) Well, I think you misunderstand what those options mean. Those mean that the optimizer is allowed to regem/reenchant items that are marked as only having a specific gemming/enchant available. You won't have any of those when loading from the armory, so that doesn't change anything. And none of your enchants will change, because after loading from the armory, you only have 1 enchant for each slot marked available (whatever you've already got).\r\n3) No idea.",

      "Message": "1) yes no \"tooltips\" when I put my mouse on \"mitigation scale\" \"tankpoints\" \"burst time\" \"damage output\" in Ranking system\r\n2) ok, is that means I must check (?) all the enchants I can do for all the items ? Previously that was not like that, it's very long And so the other problem is with the main hand and the shield, if I set \"Available for optimizer\" for mongoose, after the optimization mongoose is loaded for my shield ...I think a \"Enchant templates\" will be a good idea\r\n3) it's hapend after an optimisation",

      "Message": "1) The tooltip is there, just mouse over the asterisk at the end of each.\r\n2) Yes, you have to check each enchant; no, mongoose is never put on the shield (it shows up on the right as selectable but the optimizer will never actually put it on the shield).\r\n3) never seen this\r\n",

Also, I have actually seen a few odd bugs with enchants on the offhand, which I'm looking into.\r\n3) Are you perhaps marking only a single unique item as available, and it only equips one, because it's unique?\r\n\r\n",
