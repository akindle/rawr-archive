      "Message": "Makes sense to export as XML since you can pretty much convert XML to anything you want via an XSLT transform. Although I'll grannt you that creating an XSLT file takes a bit of XML knowledge.  But it's not that hard, there's good and easy to follow tutorials out there.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly, most modern spreadsheets will happily open an XML for you and offer means to order the information in the way you want.\r\n\r\nThe problem with supporting other formats is the obvious \"what other formats are we supposed to support?\".  Why lootplan and not some other mod as well.",

Rawr2 had an export to CSV function as well as Lootplan, and I dont know of any other mods like Lootplan. If I have to learn XSLT whatever then I will probably stop using rawr for loot lists and the like. Excel is a good tool for low tech users (like me).",
