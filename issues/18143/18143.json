    "Description": "These comments refer to the attached gearset.\n \nVersion 2.3.19 rates me at 8880 DPS vs 2.3.20 which is less.  Significantly so.  Version 2.3.18 rated me low because T10 bonuses for Moonkin needed work.  2.3.19 gave me higher numbers (a bit more realistic as seen in practice on ICC trash).\n \nWhy do my numbers drop again with .20?  It seems your equations are still changing.  /grin\n \nThank you for your time!",

      "Message": "Under 1% change is not \"significantly [less]\".  Also \"ICC Trash\" is a VERY BAD METRIC for you to judge yourself from the model to the game.  A better comparison (model/reality) would be Saurfang, or Festergut.  Also, you do not have the ICC raid-wide buff enabled, so any comparisons you make between the two are already going to be off (at the bottom of the Buffs tab).\r\n\r\nThat said, don't worry about numbers changing between versions of Rawr, as long as the change is not serious.  If you see a 10% or larger change between versions, then that's something to be worried about, and we'd really want to know about it.  There are small things, tweaks model-side, that change constantly as we update mechanics, make procs more accurate, create code, whatever.  This is normal, and I would not be surprised by a small change from version to version.  This does not affect the legitimacy of the recommendations, as the actual final DPS output is somewhat irrelevant.  The important part WHEN IT COMES TO MODELING is that the abilities and their associated buffs are accurate RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER, and used by the model in an appropriate way.",
