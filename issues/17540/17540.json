    "Description": "Started playing around with a new Paladin. Noticed that the Retrib module doesn't have the ability for the optimizer to shoot for Expertise and Hit caps as separate reqs. The \"Melee Avoid %\" I assume is just a catch all req. that enforces 100% melee hit, 100% spell hit, and no dodged/parried attacks.  Would be nice to have these things broken down into obtainable reqs. for better modeling. \n \nSpecifically, coming from the TankDK and DKDPS models, I'd like to see the following optimizer reqs. added:\nTarget Miss % (In which <=0% is the best)\nTarget Dodge % (In which <=0% is the best)\n \nFor variety and/or easiness of implementation, these other reqs. would be nice too:\nHit Rating\nExpertise Rating",
