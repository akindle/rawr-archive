    "Description": "It would be really nice if we could let people control/configure the calculations that are used. Suppose for example, I prefer Hugehoss' system or Emerald's system... how can I get it to show that?\nÂ \nWe could do lots of work to make it end-user configurable, but that might be overkill. Perhaps just a module loader API thing where people can create their own .NET DLLs that implement the requried interfaces.",
