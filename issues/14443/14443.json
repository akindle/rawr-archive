    "Description": "The optimizer is preferring to just drop the MH weapon.  Because that immediately drops the chance of the target to dodge to 0.\nI need to fix this in the module so that empty slot main-hand slot is not preferable in this case.",

      "Message": "Optimizer constraints are hard constraints. That means it'll try to do whatever it takes to meet them. But once you meet them then it'll go for whatever brings biggest value. If it picks a no weapon result that probably means that it wasn't able to meet the constraint.",

      "Message": "I agree, but I know this is an implementation problem.  A target can still dodge an unarmed attack, and therefore expertise can play a part even when there's no weapon in the main hand.  I know I can fix this, but not ready to tackle it when I wrote it up.",
