    "Description": "I thought I'd post a few feedback issues with the latest Mage checkin. \n- Arcane and Frost are taking the 4-piece T13, \n- Fire is not taking the 4-piece T13.\n- No support for the proc from the trinket Will of Unbinding (Intellect Stacking proc from Damaging Spell Cast)\n- Could not tell if program was using PTR mode or not, the option is not showing.\n- The nerf to Dragonwrath's proc (~5% now from the 10% on live) does not seem to be present.",
