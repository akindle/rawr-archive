    "Description": "I would really appreciate an upgrade to the \"Direct Upgrades\" Feature.\n \n1. Seperation by Dungeonmode on the X-Axis, 25, 25Hard, 10, 10 Hard\n2. Seperation by Dungeon on the Y-Axis\n3. Printable\n4. Removal of the Bars since that would waste too much space, just leave the DPS number\n \nSince I do this manually now, to know what I should spend my DKP on :-)\nMaybe later on I'll post a screenshot of the Excel File I print every other week or so.\nI hope I'm not the only one that would like this feature.",
