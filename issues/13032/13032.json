    "Description": "It appears you are backing into Hit/Exp based on energy costs and modeling that way.  however there is soemthing wrong with the calc.  Lets take a simple situation:\n20 attacks, 40 energy cost, total chance to avoid 5%, \nnet: 19 hit, 800 energy spent, average energy per hit 42.10526316\n \nThe calc in rawr for average energy is RawEnergy*cpgEnergyCostMultiplier\ncpgEnergyCostMultiplier = 1f + ((1f / chanceNonAvoided) - 1f) * 0.2f;\n \nIn our example above we have 40* (1+((1/.95)-1)*0.2 = 40.42105263\n \nThat's off by rather a lot and thus undervalues hit/exp a lot.",

It hadn't gotten a reply and fell off the front page so I assumed no one else agreed/no one had time to look.\r\n\r\nWith everyone so busy I figured I could provide more value if I looked into the source and tried to see if I could find anything that looked wrong myself.  Then it could be handled one way or another more quickly.\r\n\r\nThis issue report arose from that digging.",

Misses seemed to only drop me to about 50 energy, thus it looks like the energy refund, resulting in only 20% energy being used for misses, still seems to be the current situation., even 2 years later. \r\n\r\nBased on this, it seems like the formula in the code, is still accurate.",
