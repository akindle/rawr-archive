    "Description": "Working with my prot. warrior in Rawr I noticed that health values aren't displaying the same in Rawr compared to in-game.  Here are the values that I'm seeing: (Note: In-game I have mining with a bonus +3 stam.  I didn't think this would make or break the difference seen here. No professions, or buffs, were selected in Rawr.)\n \nEdit: All equipped gear values were updated before ticket was made.\n \nUntalented + naked in-game = Stamina: 176, Health: 45489\nUntalented (prot model) + no gear = Stamina: 198, Health: 45085\n \nTalented + naked in-game = Stamina: 202, Health: 45853\nTalented + no gear Rawr= Stamina: 198, Health: 45085\n \nTalented + Geared in-game = Stamina: 5196, Health: 115769\nTalented + geared Rawr = Stamina: 5192, Health: 95670\n \nWith gear and talents I'm seeing a difference of nearly 20k health.  Is there something behind the scenes that affects this?  Thanks for your time.",
