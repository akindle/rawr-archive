    "Description": "For ultraxion as an example you as a tank and random raid members get fading light, which in turns lowers your dps output, if there where a way to import this information into the boss handler, it would make it much easier to keep track of what your actual damage per second and overall damage on the boss fight should be. and each boss has a debuff like this. Some more than just one, especially in heroic mode, i find that the numbers that are reported from the sim are inaccurate because these debuffs are not accounted for and i myself am not trained well enough in coding to be able to track the amount of time the debuff happens or the percentages of raid members that they happen to, i am asking no begging at this point for a little help laughing out loud because i myself nor my guild can acount for the time spent lost on the boss and in accordance the amount of dps loss because of these debuffs. PLease help us!!! Dragon soul is not a hard instance but i would like to see how far we can push our toons.",
