    "Description": "1. As you can see in the attached file, my custom dps is greater than the \"optimal\" dps by about 300.  I don't think this is supposed to happen.\n \n2. My actual unbuffed dps on the combat dummy is about 4000 higher than that.  I make sure to clear all cp and let stacks of all procs drop off before testing.  I use clc_rogue for my rotation and to track AR and KS cooldowns.  Berserking is macroed to KS.  I was not able to use tricks for my test.\n \n3. Rawr says that Kyroptic Sigil will be almost a 3800 dps increase over Starcatcher Compass [384].  On the combat dummy, the difference was negligible.  It says that Fluid Death is more than a 5000 dps increase, but I didn't see any point of testing that on the combat dummy.",
