    "Description": "I'm looking to create some optimum gearsets for fire in 4.2, and consistently find the Necromantic Focus (nonheroic item ID 68982, heroic ID 69139) to be valued quite a bit lower than many other trinkets. When I force the trinket to a set mastery value (eg\n 450 mastery out of the 480 max stack), its value skyrockets. I have checked, and this is not due to reforging, if you equip the item and force it to not reforge, its value still goes up drastically. I believe there is an issue with how rawr.mage is currently\n modelling the mastery proc on DoT tick.",
