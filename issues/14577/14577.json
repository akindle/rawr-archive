    "Description": "It seems that Wild Growth is taken into account even when the talent is not in the talent tree.\nI tested it like this:\n  - removed Wild Growth from talents\n  - moved the WG/min slider from 0 to 9 and back\n  - Ratings changed drastically ... when they should not\nÂ \nTrees that dont have the Wild Growth talent, don't have that ability - this is causing strange suggestions for talents that exclude it, even though statistics reflect as if it was included.",

      "Message": "I assumed Resto Trees knew their class slightly and wouldn't try to use a spell that they don't have.\r\nGranted the optisimer wouldn't know this, but I believe there is too much of the talent subtleties not being modelled to attach any real value to a talent optimisation.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is changed now (change set 41661) , for both Wild Growth and Swiftmend, neither of which checked if their respective talent enabled them. The change only affects whether they are included in the model results. The first stats page will still show their numbers, irrespective of the talents, but I don't think it is worthwhile hiding all of that information as well. But if people feel it will cause confusion, I'll look at removing it as well.",
