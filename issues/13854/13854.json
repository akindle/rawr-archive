    "Description": "Hello,\n \nas the title says, selection/deselection of Rampage/Leader of the Pack under the Buffs-options doesn't has any effect on the displayed total DPS. Also the selection of Rampage/Leader of the Pack gets lost/reset when a item in any slot is changed.\n \nThx and GJ so far! :)\n \nIndiy",

      "Message": "As previously stated, this is not an issue but a new feature. Please see the patch notes.\r\n\r\nAny buff provided by the warrior class is killed in the Buff selector automatically in favor of using an actual calculational version. This provides values to talents and glyphs that would otherwise see zero gain.\r\n\r\nFor example, as a Fury Warrior with the Rampage Talent, your Talent overrides the Rampage Buff (and any alternates, such as LotP) so we can calculate it internally, this prevents double-dipping. The same logic applies to Commanding Shout (if being Maintained), Battle Shout (if being Maintained), Trauma, and Blood Frenzy. We have not set this up for Sunders yet as this stackable effect is a little harder to account for.\r\n\r\nThere is a whole section in the Options panel with Instructions now that has information pertaining basic and advanced use of the DPSWarr module.",
