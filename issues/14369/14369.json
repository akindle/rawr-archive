    "Description": "I had seen this mentioned before (several versions ago), but still seems that for some reason it has gone unfixed.  For affliction walrocks, we can enter spell priorities for haunt, corruption, and curse of agony fine.  Soon as we try to add shadow bolt or unstable affliction to that, the program freezes up.  This has been going on now for at least 3 patches as far as I'm aware of.  Considering those extra 2 spells have a major impact on our dps and the value of gear related to them, I'm sure I speak for all aff locks when I say we would like to see this fixed (finally) in the next patch.  Thank you.",

      "Message": "To clarify: You have 1. Haunt 2. Corruption 3. Curse of Agony set\r\nTHEN you add 4. Shadow Bolt and it crashes?\r\nCuz I just made a dummy character and that worked.\r\nHOWEVER, it did have a problem adding Unstable Affliction though (meaning UA was the bottom of the list).\r\n\r\nSo I did a little checking and the program isn't 'crashed' so much as it's continuing to process the file but can't get passed 7.5x seconds in the full fight rotation. I added a loopcounter to kill the loop at 5000 iterations (basically just to save myself) and it continued, the Events list stopping at 7.43 (the last point before it gets stuck).\r\n\r\nNow that I was out of the loop, I went back and added Shadow Bolt to the bottom (total list of Haunt, Corruption, Curse of Agony, Unstable Affliction, Shadow Bolt) and it worked fine, 3262 DPS. Events List went all the way to the end.\r\n\r\nSo like Hz and ArPharazon kept saying, be sure to have Shadow Bolt at the bottom of the list, without it you may get stuck.",
