    "Description": "When I set a fight to include incoming damage (for example, I created a fight to have Frost damage, 1000dps, .2 crit, 1 per second) I would expect that my survivability rating would be higher for Frost Resist items than for other resistances... especially since there are specific damage types to be entered, and I can adjust the FR available to me on other tabs.\n \nBut this appears to not be the case. Despite setting the fight to include lots of Frost damage, all the head enchants (there is one for each type of resistance) are valued identically... just due to the stamina they provide, and completely ignoring the frost.\n \nEither resistances are not being modeled, or the survivability tab is being ignored (or is poorly documented/implemented). This would be nice to fix.",

      "Message": "There are two parts that determine the survivability value. One part is from Survivability Rating at the top which is just based on your health. The second part comes from the chance to live calculation based on incoming damage. This second part is disabled by default, you have to set Survivability Score at the bottom of the panel to a value above 0, that is the survivability rating you want to associate with 100% chance to live. You'll have to play with getting the right combination of incoming damage and healing response time to get the desired survivability effect, if you go too far in either direction you might be in situation where you always live or always die. You can check chance to die at the very bottom of Stats tab in survivability section.\r\n\r\nAnd yes this is very poorly documented mainly because noone was interested in it so far.",

      "Message": "Rawr needs fight profiles. Setting survivability and fight parameters is... well, it sucks. It's tedious, error prone, and there are a ton of things to factor.\r\n\r\nSimilar to how rawr includes standard gemmings (btw, LOVE the new gem system), common talent specs, I think it should also include common fight profiles.\r\n\r\nSarth 3D, Malygos, Sapphiron, KT... fights like this should be profiles that can be selected. This would be more useful to the tanking modules, but everyone would benefit from being able to select a fight and optimize for it. Maybe your guild is stuck on Malygos... being able to optimize your gear specifically to help you survive and kill Maly would be a great benefit.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking to change the way Rawr handles fight setup; some modules to better jobs than others. But being able to just pick a fight profile, and it fills in the relevant details in the model, that would be awesome. More people would pay attention to survivability if it wasn't such a pain to model it.",
