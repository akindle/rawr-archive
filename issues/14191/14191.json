    "Description": "I am trying to update the professions filters to have separate filters for BoE & BoP items in 2.2.17 (I had issues in 2.216 as well).  The BoP filter works fine (it has existed for many versions), but I cannot get the BoE filter to work.  The BoP filters are based off of \"BoP crafted <prof>\".  I tried various forms of (?<! BoP) for the BoE filters, but nothing works.  It seems like it should be straightforward like the Heroic and (?<! Heroic) filters.  The source info in ItemSource.xml is slightly different for crafted items than for dropped items.  Any thoughts?\nÂ \nOn a side note, I submitted a patch tonight with a revamp of the filters and a manually refreshed item cache.  The only part of my new filters that I am not completely satisfied with is the above mentioned issue.  It would be a lot cleaner to have a BoP sub-tree and a BoE sub-tree under the Crafted tree than the way it is implemented.",
