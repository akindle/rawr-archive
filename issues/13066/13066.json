    "Description": "The dps listing in the trinkets in 2.2.0 feels wrong compared to 2.1.9.  Especially Darkmoon:  Greatness (agi), which was rated at ~150 dps in 2.1.9 and ~100 in 2.2.0.  If you assume hitting a little more than once per second, the proc is about 90 agi average for 95% chance to proc, so I tried editing it to 180 agi and then it's back to the top of the list like I'd expect (~225 dps).  I remember seeing Fury of the Five Flights a few versions ago too, but no clue where that went.  And is Meteorite Whetstone really better than Mirror of Truth?  It doesn't make sense to me how it could be rated so high with haste being so-so and having less crit.",
