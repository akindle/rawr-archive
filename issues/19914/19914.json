    "Description": "I would like Rawr to detect my two specs, allow me to tell it which is my Primary and which is my Secondary (just in case what I use most is not actually assigned that way in the game), have it Optimize my Primary gear set, then also Optimize my Secondary gear set based on what items are remaining in my available inventory if the Secondary optimization results in changes to items which are already part of my Primary set.\n \nFor example, Item A is found to be best for Primary spec. If Item A is also best for my Secondary spec, but with different gems/enchants/reforging, it will recommend the second-best available item from my inventory to be used and gemmed/enchanted/reforged, maintaining the integrity of the Primary gear set and its gems/enchants/reforging. (Of course, if Item A is best for both using the same modifications, it will recommend it for both sets.)\n \nThis is mainly for classes that have very similar items used between their two specs (Cat and Bear, in my case, but could also apply to others).",
