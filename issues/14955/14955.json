    "Description": "At certain gear levels, which are not hard to reach at all, a mage will gain more dps from a Reckless gem then a Runed gem. You guys probably didn't see this happening, but it definitely is. To fix this issue, you should add in a few more gem templates for Mage. Specific gem templates would be like reckless/reckless/purified/reckless/csd, or reckless/reckless/reckless/reckless/csd, and then a few versions with veiled gems in pris, yellow or red, or whatever else you think might work. You can also just remove the sp/int template, it's doing nothing but clog calculations because I guarantee you that int will never beat out sp/crit/hit/haste until cata comes out.\n \nAlso, at slightly more obscure gear levels then what is required for reckless to be > runed (which requires haste be only 10% better), pure haste will overcome pure spell power(14.7% for jewelers, 15% for regular).\n \nAlso, while you are at it with all that, you might as well add some jewelers hit gem templates as well. No need for potent or smoothe templates tho, as crit never gets that good, even with ZERO crit rating as FFB spec.\n \nPS: 1 bug to report, I told it I would be using ice armor, and I have zero + crit on my gear, so how come it says I have 633.33 crit rating? I then unchecked molten armor glyph, and it went from 633 to 429, yet im not supposed to be wearing molten armor.",

      "Message": "There is a similar issue with Boomkin and Purified Dreadstones. Rawr is suggesting I gem everything with a Dreadstone instead of the obviously more potent Runed Cardinal Ruby (+23 SP). +12 SP + 10 Spirit is surely nowhere near comparable to +23 SP under normal circumstances?",
