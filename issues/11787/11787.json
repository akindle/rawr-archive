    "Description": "I love Rawr and have been using it since your creation was only for bears, but just so I understand what is going on in WotLK I created an excel model and have a couple of quick questions:\n \n- The diminishing returns (DR) calculation for agility's contribution for dodge appears incorrect. When selected a NE untalented druid, the with and without DR avoidance results differ -- for an untalented/ungeared druid shouldn't the DR/non-DR results be equal?\n \nIt seems that the error is in the calculation for agility. Using the following (excluding NE racial) I am able match the results of Toskk's TTL model, assuming a level 80 target.\nA (dodge subject to DR - pre DR) = dodge from def rating + dodge from dodge rating + (Total Agility - 87) * 0.024\n \nBase Dodge + Dodge from base agility + Dodge from Feral Swiftness + Natural Reaction + dodge subject to DR (post DR)\n0.04951 + 87 x 0.024 + dodge from FS & NR + ( 1/(1/c+k/A))\n \nSurvival of the Fittest impacts the total agility, but should not impact the base agility which is used to calculate agility subject to DR -- assuming I'm interpreting the work of Whitetooth correctly.\n \n- I am traveling for the holiday's at the moment, so have been unable to verify in game. In Toskk's model the NE racial is considered 2% dodge, in Rawr it's 2% miss. Which of these is correct?\n \nThanks for the amazing work that you have done, and I am enjoying the MUCH faster loading of the item editor. Now if someone could only create a non mono os x solution.... hehe.",
