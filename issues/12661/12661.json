      "Message": "Your comment on empty slots got me playing around with them.  I started get some \"Direct Upgrades\" showing when I emptied a slot.  If I instead used a very poor item in the slot, I would see fewer upgrades.  I found that Heroic 5 man loot would almost always end up filtering out the best heroic raid loot.  For example, setting my headpiece to the \"Cowl of the Dire Troll\" (H DTK) results in the \"Hood of Rationality\" (H EoE) showing up as a 9.52 point upgrade.  I suspect the points for the currently equipped item are being counted twice.",
