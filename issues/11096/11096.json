    "Description": "I noticed that Inspiring/Heroic Presence is implemented in all Rawr modules, but when using the Draenei as a race, the basic 1% hit (that does stack with one other Draenei Aura of the same type as well as one of the other type) is not used in the calculations. This is at least in the Hunter and Mage modules, which I had time to check.\nÂ \nNow, using my Draenei mage in Rawr always gives the advice for more hit gems usually, even when I do not need them.",

If you are a Draenai already, then selecting or unselecting 'Heroic Presence' in the buffs will do nothing, because that buff is always on you.\r\n\r\nHowever, it might be nice if Rawr disabled controls that were pointless. For example, a mage shouldn't have to select Arcane Intellect on the buff screen, and druids shouldn't have to select Mark of the Wild. When a Rawr.Mage has 'Automatic Armor' selected, the buffs tab could disable the mage's selection of armor.",

I'll try to explain what problem I found.\r\n\r\nIf I load the Armory Data of a Dwarf Hunter (in this sample 217 unbuffed +hit), Rawr will show me a 98,62% hit chance for a lvl 83 mob (no Buffs checked on in Rawr Buffs Section).\r\nThis Stat is quite not correct while I only got + 6,62% with my 217 +hit witch results on a unbuffed +hit an a lvl 83 mob of 97,62%.\r\nWhen I now check on \"heroic presence\" in the Rawr Buffs section the Hit will remain on 98,62%, so it seams that Rawr always add the \"heroic presence\" +1% also to a Dwarf Hunter if the Buff is unchecked.\r\n\r\nI hope you can follow my discription now, i did my best to explain the problem in english ;-)\r\n\r\n",
