    "Description": "When I initially load a frost mage file, either existing or download new from Battle.net, gear is ranked by survivability. If I change the mage spec to fire, gear is evaluated for dps, but tier pieces are given a negative rating. I tried this for my own mage Veviseron-Eitrigg and for Omnia-Stormreaver (both logged out as frost). Loading Omnia-Ticondrius (logged out as fire) worked normally.",
