    "Description": "Libram of Veracity wowhead Item 47662, hasn't shown up in the default items for Healadin module.  Listed as  Each time you cast Holy Light, you have a chance to gain 234 spell power for 15 sec, procs the spell Holy judgement, wowhead 67364.. rumored to have a 10 sec internal cool down.\n \nItem appears to be found in item editor but doesn't show up for evaluation.  I attempted to model a trigger off Holy Light for, but the closest I could find on Healingspellcast, and then enter the cooldowns.\n \nI know the result is very skewed because it's a specific heal, Holy Light.  Any way I can model this properly currently?",
