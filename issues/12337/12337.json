    "Description": "I manually added in the two new enchants that are being added into patch 3.0.8 (Enchant Bracer - Major Stamina [40 Stam] and Enchant Weapon - Titanguard [75 Stam]) to the EnchantCache xml file so that I can compare the new enchants. The program is able to recognize the enchants when I go to enchant drop-down. However ONCE I select the enchants to be placed on the items, it says that there is no enchants selected.",
