      "Message": "Strange. It posted before I was ready. Oh well.\r\nWithout FI I have 1008 dps points and with FI I have 1069 dps points, which is a 6.1% increase in dps. Isn't FI just a plain 3% increase in dps? Or does the calculations guess that I have more than one hunter in the group?\r\nMy guess is that it does some calculation regarding the uptime, and the pet crits about every 4.8 seconds. Then the calculation misses that the buff is refreshed and doesn't stack for a single hunter.",

That's what that line of code in CalculationsCat is for; it should add the 3% bonus again for each extra time set on the Options tab. If this isn't what you're seeing, let me know.",
