    "Description": "I have been trying to model this in Rawr, but neither putting in the current proc (+25% white damage) or the PTR proc (680 weapon damage) make any difference to the value of the trinket (over the value of the trinket with no proc - ie. just the flat 321 Agi).\n \nI have tried resetting the cache and also quitting out and reloading Rawr, but nothing seems to change it.\n \nAttached my character in case it is of help.",

Much better for the guild to sell them and use the gold for repairs & flasks etc.   Having looked at the change to it though, it may actually be a decent upgrade in which case I may request it back again (if not already sold)\r\n\r\n",
