    "Description": "I understand that each version has to hard-code the basic gems template that are used by the Rare and JC gems. However for the SPriest, the JC gems include such gems as Rigid King's Amber, Runed Cardinal Ruby, Quick King's Amber, Smooth King's Amber, and Solid Majestic Zircon. These gems are epic gems that were data-mined during the beta and were not implemented into Live. I like what was done with the mage gemming, and splitting up the gems into uncommon, Rare, and epic (which can be edited at a later date once Epic gems drop). Then within each section split them up by the blue gem ( Purified, Glowing, Royal, and JC [Runed Dragon's Eye]). If possible, could this be implemented?",
