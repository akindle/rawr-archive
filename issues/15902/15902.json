      "Message": "I just looked after you posted Jothay and did find where the code is in the Hunter Module.  It just seems strange that the Excel spreadsheet is showing such a big difference in estimated value of Zods.  The Rawr module lists Zods under the Talonstrike bow while the Excel sheet has Zods coming in as quite a big upgrade.  Likely the difference is from how the model of the proc is being handled.\r\n",
