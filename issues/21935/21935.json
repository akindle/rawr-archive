    "Description": "I used epic gem in my gear, but not allowed it for optimizer in Gemming Templates (ofc. gems are expensive, I use it only when it drop me).\n \nWhen start Optimizer, it ask me:\n \nThe following currently equipped items are not available\n \nBrilliant Queen's Garnet is not available\n \nYou most likely ......\n \nWould you like to make them available and continue with the optimization?\n \nAnd buttons Yes   No Cancel\n \nFirst: two questions: available and contiue is bad, because what I need to press when I like not to make available but like to continue with the optimization.\nBetter will be .... for optimization?\n \nSecond: when I press:\nYes - optimizer ask me infinitely again and again .... (I do not know what you planed to do during optimize process, but expect that epic gem will be available in all cases where is reasonable to use it = player have many epic gems)\n \nNo - stop asking but not keep epic gem in my weared gear in result of optimization. I suggest to leave it not changed but not use epic gems in rest gear items.",
