    "Description": "With an attack power of 19980, spell power of 10949 and tremendous tankard of terror in OH, I'm getting 285.8 dps from lava lash attacks.  The number of attacks per minute looks right (5.22) but that comes out to 3285 average dmg per LL.  This is off by a factor of 10 or more.  Total dps is way off as a result.",
