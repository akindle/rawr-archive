    "Description": "The Water Elemental does not seem to benefit from buffs selected in the Buffs tab.\n \nParticularly, buffs selected under the categories Damage (%), Haste (%), Spell Critical Strike Chance, Spell Haste, Spell Power, Critical Strike Chance Taken, Spell Critical Strike Taken, Spell Damage Taken and Spell Hit Chance Taken have no effect on the damage contribution from Waterbolt when mouse hovering By Spell in the Stats tab. All those effects increase, eg, Frostbolt damage contribution, but not Waterbolt.\n \nWaterbolt damage is modified when selecting Spell Power buffs (Flametongue totem, etc), but only due to scaling from the caster's improved spell power. This can be verified by removing Flametongue from the buff selection and editing any equipped item to add the Flametongue  bonus to gear.\n It should also benefit directly from Spell Power buffs (effectively double dipping from Flametongue and similar effects).",

      "Message": "Yea I know this needs some cleanup. The thing is that it has to be done per buff to determine whether it applies or not. Only buffs that are debuffs or auras apply to water elemental. I had it working fine before the buff homogenization, but I probably left some stuff out at that point. I'll give another pass over it when I get some time.",
