      "Message": "I honestly would prefer the flexibility of it telling me the best option given my talents, whether DW or 2H, but it's got to be right. :) And right now the results I'm getting from the DKTank module are completely bizarre. When running the optimizer for the gear I own, it seems completely obsessed with the Peacekeeper blade and that I should use it even if it's the only weapon in my hands even though it's a 1-hander. So I was pondering effective ways to deal with this problem, as what it keeps suggesting is not a viable equipment combination.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there is probably a deeper problem here but I'm not sure what it is, and I know you have a number of work items to bring DKTank up to speed with 3.2 so I didn't want to go on about it since one or more of those might help as well.\r\n\r\nDKDPS, oddly, has not suggested I go to DW.",

      "Message": "Ahh... I think I know what happened.  There were some errors in the code dealing w/ DW and 1-handers in my code.  Specifically around parry-haste and all that.  \r\nIn my latest build (post .13 release) when I mark Peacekeeper as unique with your setup, it now gives me Sen'jin protector in MH and Peacekeeper in the OH.  Using Bladeward on both.  Even using Swordbreaking on both is providing significant mitigation improvements.  Using the Compare Sets dialog we can see the direct changes that happen when just upgrading your rune to Stone Gargoyle improves your survival a bit and mitigation quite a bit.  \r\n\r\nHowever, when running the optimizer and including RoSG - we keep the 2H with the new run and it shuffles some of your other enchants around and using the Sigil of the Unfaltering Knight and a trinket shift.  Even when I pull the Sigil out, we still see staying w/ the 2h.  \r\n\r\nAre these the kinds of results you were more expecting?",
