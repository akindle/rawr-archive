    "Description": "I tried to edit the ring enchant in the 2.3.3 version of Rawr, but every time I go and try to open that character file, I get an error. Also, rogues are showing DW trinket at 45-50% proc rate and the ring being a 1ppm 60sec ICD if you want to update that in Rawr.\n \nSee the end of this message for details on invoking \njust-in-time
