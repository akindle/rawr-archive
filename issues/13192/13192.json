    "Description": "This might just be a lack of my understanding, but I was wondering how results like this happen (see pic).\n \nI optimized my gear yesterday with Rawr, then went in-game and made all the suggested changes.  Then today I loaded my profile from the armory, and reran the optimizer (several times, as suggested).  The only suggestions it makes, is that I swap my two rings between my finger slots, and that it will up my DPS score by 200!\n \nDo rings actually change functionality when put in different slots?\n \nIs there another underlying change happening somewhere in the calculation?  It would be nice if it told me everything it was changing (food, talents, buffs, etc.) that are impacting the score.",
