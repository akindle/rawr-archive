    "Description": "If I close Rawr v2.2.5 with the Healadin module active, it won't open any more (closes itself without an visible error after the splash screen).\nI tried clean reinstalls and rebooting but nothing helped. Only deleting the Rawr folder in Local Settings\\Application Data fixed the issue.\n \nWay to reproduce it:\n1. Clean install of Rawr v2.2.5, Rawr folder in Local Settings\\Application Data deleted.\n2.a. Open a existing character XML file containing a Healadin character.\nor\n2.b. Switch to the Healadin module manually.\n3. Close Rawr.\n4. Try to open it again. Doesn't work, it closes itself after the splash screen.\n \nI also noticed that I will sometimes just crash (without visible error) when Rawr is already started and I try to switch to the Healadin module. But I couldn't find a way to reliably reproduce this yet.\n \nI didn't had this problem in v2.2.4.\nUsing Windows XP Prof. SP3 with .NET 3.5 SP1",
