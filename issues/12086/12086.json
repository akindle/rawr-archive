    "Description": "I just noticed that the Meteorite Whetstone shows up as having 111 haste rating (tried reloading from Armory and Wowhead to make sure it wasn't just in my cache like that). That can't possibly be right, can it? With 444 haste rating on proc, a 10 second duration, and a 45 second internal cooldown, even the absolute best case should only be 98.66.",
