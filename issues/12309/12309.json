    "Description": "I select an number of pieces of gear for optimization that I currently possess in game.  As soon as I refresh my profile from armory, all those items I select as being available for optimizer get cleared.  The otimized items also get cleared apon closing RAWR.\nÂ \nThis is frustrating as I have to continually go through each slot and select every piece of gear I possess in order to use optimizer.  This didn't occur in 2.1.4.",
