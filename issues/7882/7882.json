      "Message": "I also miss the functionality of a talent editor in both bear and cat models. You might be crazy if you think that everyone who wants to use Rawr is best suited to have your exact prescribed set of talents for both models. :) For example, as I am nearing the armor cap in bear form, and my gear choices keep me 1% past uncrittable, I may soon feel comfortable dropping 1 point from the Thick Hide talent and one point from Survival of the Fittest to take two points in Nurturing Instinct. Rawr's gear optimization fails to be precise in this scenario.",
