    "Description": "Two users have reported the same issue with v2.2.0.9 in that when they load their file and goto tools | optimise  select \"dps rating\" as the thing to optimise then click optimise button they get results back that suggest removing a ring all together. ie: leaving one of the ring sockets empty!!\nÂ \nI cannot understand what might be causing this and can't see how it could be model specific so I'm logging an issue. I can repeat it every time with the release v2.2.0.9.",
