    "Description": "I've started to use the DPSDK module of Rawr for my DK alt on the 2.3.1 version of Rawr and to change the rotation I had to go to the options pane and click on \"Rotation Details\".\n \nI had a little break from the DK because i was focusing on my Main, but now i opened Rawr 2.3.8 and i cant find the rotation config, i saw that on 2.3.7 release notes the author wrote this: \"- Rawr.DPSDK: Moved location of Rotation information to the options pane\" ok but i don't have this info on my option tab and i can't find it anywhere else =|\n \nI have attached a pic of my options pane, thx for the help.",

      "Message": "I second this. I personally preferred being able to set my own rotation, but could live with only being able to have it use auto-generated \"optimal\" rotations. However, for this to have any value at all it needs to at least have a way of displaying that optimized rotation to understand how it is calculating its numbers. As it is with the current version, there is no longer even a way to see what rotation is being used to come up with the theoretical dps numbers.",
