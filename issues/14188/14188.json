    "Description": "RAWR advised to put an Insightful Earthsiege Diamond into a helm, which requires one blue, one yellow, and one red gems.  However, under several different gear optimizations, the only gems suggested were yellow.  No red, no blue.  Hence it seems to be an invalid recommendation.\nÂ \nShouldn't meta gem requirements be taken into account?  (I read in a post of last year that there was such a checkbox in the Options panel, but in v2.2.17 I see no such option.)",
