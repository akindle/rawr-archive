    "Description": "Something that would be nice to add in. Esp for a class like me . Im a druid and i always atleast play 2 specs in every raid. Tank and dps. Sometimes melee dps sometimes caster. Sometimes i even heal. Now for classes like me or even most others that have multi specs they use often it is kinda a pain to keep alt-tabbing out and haveing to swap the gear spec saved on rawr and look to see if that item is on the upgrade list. Could we get an added function to where you can basically print out other a text based page with the items names and what bosses they drop from or even somethign like the page that is displayed in rawr with the pictures of the items so forth and the names and bosses attached to the item somewhere so you can see it as it is printed out. Thank you just an idea.",

      "Message": "Yeah i know about the one for coping to clipboard which is nice i can atleast print out he names of the items i am looking for. But thats all. All the info is on rawrs page after optimizing . would it be that much more coding to have it also include info about the items. I.E. who and where it drops. gem set up. and maybe even enchants. Maybe this is just me being lazy but i try to keep as little windows open when i am in game raiding as to know that i will not have any problems so i always print out the list but i have to write in all the other info. And for someone like me a druid i accualy have and carry 4 sets of gear while raiding.  Stam tank set. Pure mitt set. kitty dps set . and usually my healing set also.  Thou i dont have to heal often. There are times where we could or are short healers for the night and it only takes me like 2 mins to respec. It was just an idea.  And i know for the most part it probly doesn't matter , its not to hard to really figure out. but are you ever gonna consider incorperating pvp into the optimizing ?",
