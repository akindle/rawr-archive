I don't even have tests for those missing 6 yet.  But it gets something more available for DPSDK and TankDK to get a better handle on those sigils. \r\n\r\nThe ones I haven't written code for yet are the all the Increases damage of X ability(ies) by Y amount.  Haven't gotten around to figuring out how best to add that to the stats value that's being returned. \r\n\r\nI haven't written tests for the other 2 functions in SpecialEffects.cs yet, I was just getting some test code specifically for Sigils to get them integrated into the models.",
