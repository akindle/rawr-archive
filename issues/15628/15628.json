    "Description": "Hello!\n \nI've got a question: How is this trinket calculated?\n \n158 SP + 1625 Mana restored 2 min. CD - this would be about 67,7 Mp5\n \nMy overall rating of this trinket is 664,52 (calculated with the \"Special Effect\").\nIf I change the Special Effect into a normal Mp5 of 67 my overall rating is 1119,77 (nearly the same like Talisman of Resurgence)\n \nI am just wondering, because I tried to find the rule such a trinket effect is calculated. \n \nI tried it out with the use effect of Talisman of Resurgence (599 SP for 20 sec. / 2 min. CD). I removed the effect and replaced it with an average of it (100 SP all the time) and the rating is nearly the same.\n \nWhy is this such a big difference? Is the calculation of the special effect \"Mana restore\" wrong or am I? Sorry, but I don't understand it. ^^\n \nPS: Sorry for my English. ;)\n \nEdit:\n \nI tried to halve the CD of \"Mana restore\" because of rumors (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50346#comments) the heroic version would have an 1 min. CD and nothing changed... Now I'm sure there's something wrong. ^^",

Sorry, I'm from Germany. ^^\r\nFirst I thought you mean my char and it's configuration in Rawr... so, sorry for missunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that you mean the configuration of the special effect? If it's so - I \"modeled\" nothing of it by myself... It was loaded from armory.\r\n\r\nTooltip text of the trinket:\r\nEquip: Increases spell power by 158.\r\nUse: Restores 1625 mana. (2 Min Cooldown)\r\n\t\r\nThis is the configuration loaded from armory:\r\nspecial effect: Mana restore: 1625\r\nTrigger: use\r\nDuration: 0\r\nCooldown: 120\r\nChance: 100,00%\r\nStacks: 1\r\n\r\nThis configuration sounds right, but it isn't. If I remove it at all item rating doesn't change. So this default effect configuration does nothing. And that's what I tried to say. ^^ Somewhere in Rwar something's wrong, isn't it? o.O",
