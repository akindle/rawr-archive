    "Description": "Currently, the DPSDK module auto-filters tank and caster plate gear so it doesn't spend time trying to calculate those items when performing Upgrade List queries.  I would like to see the same feature added for the TankDK module as well, in that it filters out caster and DPS gear.  I understand that some DPS gear could actually be used for tanks for the extra threat, but at the very least have the module auto-filter caster plate.  It's just not needed, and I don't feel like having to delete those items every time I upgrade Rawr and have the item cache replaced.",
