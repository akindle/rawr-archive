    "Description": "I downloaded the new version and now every time I try to do an upgrade list it freezes at different percentages. For example, it will freeze at 60% and I can not cancel the request or even close rawr unless I restart. \nNot sure if anyone is having the same issues, but if someone knows how to fix it that would be great :D",
