    "Description": "First of all I have to say very good work with this tool :-) But nevertheless I found a few problem when i worked with it:\n \nIn the standard item view the gemming of the items is quite incorrect. For example the tool puts the old meta gems in the helm slot and the BoP juwe gems (it does it too when i changed the filter). \nThis is very odd when i want to compare my items.\nLike you can see on the attachment my helm is very better than it should be just because of the gemming (which is in fact not really the case)\n \nNot sure if this is a problem of the ProtWarr module or of the whole tool",
