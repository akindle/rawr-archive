    "Description": "I've experienced this issue only on Healadin model at the moment; some random items like Reinforced Sapphirium Mantle and Darkmoon Card: Tsunami are correctly cached with all statistics (I can find them from \"Edit Items\" window), but when I try to equip them from gear lists I can't find them.\nI tried to enable every drop source, all ilvl and type of items from filters but nothing changed.\nResetting cache, deleting the specific item from cache and reloading it from wowhead doesn't work either, I think they just miss the link to this specific module, in fact the Darkmoon Card does show in the Druid Resto model.",
