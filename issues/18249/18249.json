    "Description": "Raging Deathbringer, 245 ilvl 1H Axe from Onyxia 25, is showing up very high on the list for my rogue's mutilate spec.\n \nI didn't notice it on the Comparison Pane list in the past, thought it was probably there.  Last night I ran the Upgrade List Builder for the first time on this toon (never made use of that tool before), and it showed up in the #1 and #4 slots on my list.\n \nI've seen a hundred threads where someone reported an error that wasn't really an error, just their misunderstanding, so I apologize if this is one of those cases.\n \nAttached char xml and upgrade list xml.",
