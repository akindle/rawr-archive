    "Description": "I'm having issues running this in every browser on my laptop and on the installed version. The problem is the same regardless of what I do, the windows goes completely white and everything disappears. The right click menu does pop-up so I'm assuming this isn't a Silverlight crash.\n \nNo matter what I do this happens. If I leave the app alone once it loads this doesn't happen, just when I try to do something. It gives no errors, popups or warnings, etc.\n \nIm running Silverlight 4.0.50917.0, Application storage quota is set at 32mb and showing current as 4.5mb.",
