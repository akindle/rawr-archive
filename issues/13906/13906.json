      "Message": "This is not a model issue, but rather a bug with the way Rawr itself applies Heroic Presence when you select Draenei as a race.  The ProtPaladin module checks to see if the player is a Draenei and forces that toon to have the Heroic Presence buff.  The problem exists is after it does that, it goes back to Rawr itself, notices that you selected Draenei, and applies the Heroic Presence buff.... a second time.\r\n\r\nIn any model, you can change the race between Draenei and an alliance race back and forth many times, and eventually you'd have a cap'd out hit rating when naked!  Kind of a funny bug.\r\n\r\nWhat Jothay is referring to is that some models, like the ProtPaladin model, force heroic presence on Draenei.  In models that don't do this, you can uncheck Heroic Presence as a Draenei, and the model won't automatically turn it on for you.",
