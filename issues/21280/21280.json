    "Description": "You can test this by editing a trinket to add or remove spellpower. Calculated dps and threat do not change.\nÂ \nSoul Casket is a viable tanking trinket because of its 321 Mastery. It's off the GCD so I can't see any reason not to macro it to Avenging Wrath. The OnUse adds several hundred damage to Judgement and Avenger's Shield.",
