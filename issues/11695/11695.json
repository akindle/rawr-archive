    "Description": "Having used rawr in TBC with my mage i was very excited when i saw that a dps death knight model had been added. Yet when i attempted to load my character (Darthvoder of Barthilas) i received an error message stating in exact words \"Rawr encountered an error while attempting to load a saved image. If you encounter this error multiple times, please ensure Rawr is unzipped in a location where you have full read/write access, such as your desktop, or my documents.\" \nÂ \nI have so far tried running Rawr from my desktop, my documents, loading another dk from the armory, re-downloading Rawr 2.1.1  and using Rawr 2.1. Having also tried loading characters of other classes and servers i have received no errors unlike the one above which occurs without fail every time i attempt to load a death knight from the armory",
