The import window will only accept 12 characters!\nThe error is \"Rawr: Invalid Rawr data entered please check you have copied data\" etc\nI'm using rawr 4.2.4, and the addon is v0.68 (rUnknown)\nI've attached the xml, but that's not the problem. The restricted import window is the problem.\nCheers,\nToby",
