    "Description": "It's easy to overlook if the checkbox is checked, and not immediately obvious of the changes it made, as the talent or buffs tab is often not active, unless gear which is always displayed.\n \nThis caused confusion for me, and also http://rawr.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=15382\n \nI would suggest that you at least have a note, say, in the center above the optimization result saying \"And X was also changed\". A more long term solution would be to have the Optimizer Results window have tabs of it own, for Gear, Talents, Buffs, etc. To show the before and after of everything the optimizer changed.",
