    "Description": "If I select Enchanted Tear in a blue socket, all items with a socket seems to show up very high in the list with that gem selected. The gem then has no info beside it. E.g it makes Titanium Earthguard ring show up as nearly the best ring, even though the only applicable stats are 63 stam and 50 str. The gem shows up as no contributing stats. I'm feral cat.",

      "Message": "That's because an Enchanted Tear lets you meet your metagem bonus, which you wouldn't meet otherwise. And yeah, it not showing its stats is a bug, I'll try to get that fixed. (Just a display bug though, it's counted correctly).\r\n\r\nYeah, max DPS for a Cat right now is typically all 16str gems, plus 1 enchanted tear in a blue socket, to get a socket bonus, plus fill the metagem requirement.",
