Continuing:\r\n\r\nI have 71 Defense Rating and 52 Resilience (reported by both Rawr and the blizard UI).\r\n\r\nThe Blizzard UI reports 71 Defense Rating yeilds 1.20% reduction in crit chance, and 52 Resiliance gives 1.32%. Summing to 2.52% > 2.50% (even with rounding it would only be 2.51%). \r\n\r\nRawr reports that I'm critable by 0.08097565% and short 8 def or 4 resil.\r\n\r\nAttaching Gear in XML",
