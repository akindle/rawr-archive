    "Description": "I don't see this issue posted on the forums already. I noticed while trying to Optimize my Mage that Focus Magic doesn't appear to be applied. My crit in before is exactly 3% less than it should be, and when I select/deselect FM as a buff it does not change the number. This is particularly annoying when trying to Optimize a Frost Mage using the Crit Soft Cap. :P Also, Rawr is trying to Optimize me for 33.33% Crit, when to my understanding the accepted Soft Cap taking Boss Crit Suppression into consideration is 34%.",
