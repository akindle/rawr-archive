    "Description": "I'm trying to plan my priest for level 80, and I started by trying to load from armory my priest. Now my priest has Discerning Eye of the Beast (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42992), however she is currently only lvl 76. She also has the Dignified Headmaster's Charge (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42947). The problem it looks like is that RAWR cannot handle the level attribute for BoA items. Because when I try loading my character, I get the error message:\n \nStep Name: Get Item\nDescription: Rawr encountered an error getting Item from Armory: 42992\nInput string was not in a correct format.\n   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer& number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)\n   at System.Number.ParseInt32(String s, NumberStyles style, NumberFormatInfo info)\n   at Rawr.SpecialEffects.ProcessEquipLine(String line, Stats stats, Boolean isArmory)\n   at Rawr.Armory.GetItem(Int32 id, String logReason)\n \nI understand that RAWR is designed for lvl 80 toons. But I was curious if, for BoA items, to load from Armory by just getting the item id, and enchant. Have in the item listing the BoA stats only That way the level information doesn't affect the final numbers.",
