    "Description": "Merlin's Robe no longer appears for me in 2.2.0.  I have all the filters set correctly and it's the only item I've noticed isn't showing up.  If I change my race (under Stats) to Orc, the horde version (47604) appears.  If I change back to human though, the alliance version is still missing.",

Rawr ships with default set of items, filters etc but its up to the user to add missing items. Select what filters they want etc. The tools to add and edit items exist a lot of people never seem to use them though.",
