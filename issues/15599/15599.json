    "Description": "In the last couple of versions Rawr's tooltips have begun to overlap text. It seems like it's mainly overlapping gems over socket bonuses. Some items show it (heroic Distant Land, non-heroic Bloodfall, all displayed gemmings of each) while others display normally. I attached a screenshot; I hope it can be seen, as I suck with image manipulation and cropping.",
