    "Description": "Description: There is no easy way to create a full screen 3D model of a character, it is necessary to manually locate DisplayID's and build the URL by hand to do so. Viewing how an itemset looks is fun, and should not be a terribly complex addition to the fantastic Rawr application.\n \nSuggestion: Add a \"View in Wowhead ModelViewer\" link to the menu/toolbar. This link would take the DisplayID's of each equipped item (Wowhead stores this data for the \"View in 3D\" link) and build the URL that allows a full screen 3D model. \n \nDetails: The Wowhead Modelviewer can be accessed with the following URL. The segment after the ? mark are the paramaters Rawr would supply (Race/Gender, and then the 'equiplist' section):\nhttp://static.wowhead.com/modelviewer/ModelView.swf?model=taurenmale&modelType=16&ha=0&hc=0&fa=0&sk=0&fh=0&fc=0&contentPath=http://static.wowhead.com/modelviewer/&blur=1&equipList=1,59675,3,51577,16,56737,5,59047,4,9995,9,50510,10,60539,6,60544,7,60525,8,60639,22,57237,13,60564,14,54064",
