    "Description": "I downloaded v2.1.9, and as an arcane mage I was interested to see “Compute Optimal Arcane Cycles” under Options/Advanced – however, all that button has succeeded in doing for me is lock the program, (“not responding” etc). have you had this issue with others? Would love to see it fixed as rotations for mages are all important for dps!\n \nmy armory details are: http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Darkspear&n=Flaygarth",
