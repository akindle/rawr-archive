      "Message": "I think what he is getting at is perhaps a filter setting. Like just show what you want out of ulduar 10, or naxx 25, much like how you can filter out profesion upgrades and BC items. Sometimes a large list can be overwhelming, especially when you only do some of the instances that have upgrades. So perhaps more freedom to limit the upgrade lists would be nice.",

To be honest though, this would be a downgrade from the current system because you won't be able to simply go after the biggest upgrade (within your reach) and ignore the other, lesser ones.",

You can sort of use filters it for what I have in mind, but it's a bit of a cludge.\r\n\r\nIt's more a feature for people that go raiding in pugs where you can't save some sort of DKP to get that uber item from the last boss but where you sort of \"roll for whatever is an upgrade to what you have\" rather than \"what do I need to save my dkp for\".\r\n\r\nselect the instance, get a list of bosses with for each boss which potential upgrades he drops.\r\nif you get the choice to go to one or another instance you can even see which instanc ewill offer you the best or biggest chance at upgrades.",
