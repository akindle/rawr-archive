You can quickly do so on the Current Gear chart. Or if it ever leaves a slot (item or enchant) empty, that means you didn't mark an item/enchant available for that slot.",

      "Message": "Not necessarily.  If I ever go for a low thoroughness (roughly 40%), I've noticed that I sometimes end up with a lower score than my current score.  This may be due to the high number of gemming templates I use combined with the very low thoroughness setting.  I can attempt to reproduce this, if you like.  What's surprising is that I assume there is a check to ensure that the value of the new set is â‰¥ the value of the current set.\r\n\r\nIn the vast, overwhelming majority of cases, however, the issue is not marking something as available to the optimizer - be it gems, enchants, or gear.",

Then I have separate stand-alone gems for JC Arp, JC/epic Expertise, JC/epic Hit Rating, the +10stats and +6stats gems (+6 stats occasionally is an upgrade over my 10arp/15sta blue gem; +10stats always is).\r\n\r\nAs for the original report, though, it's quite clear what happened.  All the items were checked (or at least there were items checked for each slot).  None of the enchants were checked except for a shoulder enchant.",
