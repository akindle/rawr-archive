    "Description": "I just downloaded Rawr 2.1.9 and I have never had issues with Rawr before (2.1.8 still runs just fine) but I get the following error message when I try to open 2.1.9.  I first got the error after opening 2.1.9 once and then I chose to load my character from the Armory.  I then received an error box that asked me if I wanted to close the program or try to ignore the error.  I chose to close and attempted to reopen which is where I am stuck at now.\nÂ \nI can't copy and paste like the error suggests but I can take a screenshot of it!",
