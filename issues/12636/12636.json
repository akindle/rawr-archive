    "Description": "I feel that a better design could be implemented for Proc/Use effects at present it looks like it has organically grown as each new effect was identified and added this leads to dozens and dozens of \"special effects\" variables within the stats class this is extremely messy and makes it next to impossible for a module designer to be sure that they have covered every last possibility.\n \nI was thinking it should be possible to standardise this by having a ProcUse class. The base class would store the standard parameters eg: use or proc; cooldown; proc rate; chance on hit; chance on crit etc. As well as the computed average values eg: average spellpower or attack power granted. Instances of this class could then describe the various trinkets etc in a consistent fashion\n \nThis would standardise the design of the stats so that you had a distinct separation between the total gear stats and the proc/use stats. At present the Stats class is used for base stats and has grown extra arms legs and other unidentifiable limbs to cope with all the weird procs Blizzard have introduced. A ProcUse class could (should?) subclass Stats and provide the extra information in a standard consistent format.\n \nModules that used a simple calculation could just add the two to get average stats. Modules that used more sophisticated calculation methods could then use standard methods from the ProcUse class to get the PPM rate or the cooldown or the proc effect values etc.",
