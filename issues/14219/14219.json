    "Description": "Looks like they're going through with the changes to armor penetration in the current patch. I've been trying to use Rawr v2.2.15 on my Mac via Mono/Terminal, but it keeps crashing on me on startup. I wouldn't suppose there's any way to manually update the value on ArmorPen from 1.25 to 1.10 so I can run some calculations while we wait for the servers to come back up, would there?",
