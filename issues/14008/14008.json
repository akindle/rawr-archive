    "Description": "I upgraded to 2.2.14 a little while ago and noticed that for my trinkets (I'm a bear tank, Rawr!), Death's Verdict was nowhere to be found.  It has a proc on it for 510 agility OR strength (Whichever's higher), in addition to a static 288 attack power.  I scrolled way down, and it looks like it was only modeling the attack power correctly.  Upon editing the item, the proc was correctly put in the special effects, but it was still not modelling right.  If I changed the special effect to just agility (which it would be for me), it shot up to the top of my trinkets list.\nÂ \nI think the strength/agility special effect doesn't work correctly.",
