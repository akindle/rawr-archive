    "Description": "According to Elitist Jerks as well as my personal observations (my own ans seen on other Ass Rogues) it appears as though the Rawr.Rogue is valuing Expertise above Haste and Mastery.\nÂ \nI'm not entirely sure if Rawr is changing the Stat values dependent on the Specialization of the Rogue or if some other mechanic is causing the bloated Expertise values.",
