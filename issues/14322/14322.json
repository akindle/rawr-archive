    "Description": "Not sure if these should be separate tickets, as it only relates to the beta release of the Mac-compatible web-based version\n \n1. The Gemming Template has no tooltips showing for me, and no instructions on how to use it, nor is it very intuitive.\n2. Talent names not in mouseover tooltip - would help a fair amount, especially newer people.\n3. Survival Instincts icon wrong - 3rd row down in Feral talent tree.\n4. Load From Armory would ideally immediately move the text input cursor to the 'Name' block of the pop-up.\n5. Load From Armory could use a drop-down of server names.\n6. Mouse scroll button would be useful to scroll up & down in the right-hand pane listing gear/talents etc.\n7. Enforce Gem Requirements has an asterisk by it but no tooltip.\n \nDefault Cat Spec not optimized for single-target dps. I suggest you see FBN spec at\nhttp://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid#-mPapt0zGRQT46,,9704\nor\nCat DPS Guide For Dummies'\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?talent#0ZEMMsfrz0eo0huAkbAczb:VpmVzc\n \nMy specs:\n2.8GHz iMac\n4GB RAM\nMac OS X 10.6.1\nFirefox browser (but using the 'Install Offline' version - seems to work fine and is perfectly stable).\nHave only used the Feral Cat models so far if that makes any difference.\n \nIf someone could enlighten me as to how these issues should have been posted I'd much appreciate it.",
