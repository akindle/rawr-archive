    "Description": "It may simply my lack of knowledge but since yesterday I miss the file bosses.cs and bosses2.cs in the Rawr.Base sourcecode, so I can't compile the build anymore. I've deleted my svn directory and set up everythign from scratch but the same result. Also when I browse the source code online I can not find those files. Can someone please check ?\n \nIf its just my fault I would appriciate if someone can give me a hint on how to get those files again.\n \nMany thanks,",
