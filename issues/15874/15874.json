      "Message": "This is currently standard. RAWR handles all procs as average over the entire fight. So if you have a trinket that procs for 300 SP for 20 seconds with a 60 second cd (hypothetically speaking) that would equate to an average SP uptime of 100 SP. Then RAWR will average that sp into your total Spell power.",
