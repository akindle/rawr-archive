    "Description": "It would be nice you it were possible to create a filter that (for example) removes all gear with Spell Power. I imagine casters would similarly benefit from filtering out gear with Attack Power.  I hacked together a python script that added a Note to all gear with Spell Power and this took my Build Upgrade List from around 7 minutes to around 2.5.",

Where the user draws the line on the flexibility in their gearing typically depends on what class / spec they are.\r\n\r\nYes, it's a good idea, and I really like how Jothay (I think it was you, but it may have been ebs) has implemented it in the Options panel of the DPSWarr module.  Try playing with it there, and report back how you like it.  I don't know how involved/specific/time-consuming the coding is with it, but that code could potentially be ported to the other models, and implemented in a way that works well for that particular model.",

Granted it isn't a top 5 stat so we don't see it out but it is a core stat.",

If you completely ignore the Int on mail gear, it still has the same amount of stats as leather and plate gear (technically, more than plate, due to the intricacies of having 5 stats versus 4).  Of course it has value for those that value Int (most notably Enh Shammy, as you mentioned, but also Hunters to a much lesser extent), but I'm not even going into that, only making a note that it is completely free in terms of itemization budget on mail physical DPS gear.",

      "Message": "\"All models should have settings for Relevant Stats anyway to add a user defined filter would only add confusion to the user interface.\"\r\n\r\nWell, Stamina is a relevant stat for all tanks but I'd still like to remove all of the items that have STA and Spell Power. Crit and Haste are relevant for all dps, but again it would be nice to filter out all items with AP for casters, and SP for everyone else.\r\n\r\nMy quick little hack made building an upgrade list twice as fast, so it seems like a worthwhile thing.\r\n",

      "Message": "woah, wait, did you just say you wanted to filter all gear with Stamina on it? You do realize that would considerably knock out most of the gear you would be looking at, including a large amount of gear you actually want?\r\n\r\nAny additional filters are specific to models and are at the discretion of the model dev to add but some would be ridiculous to consider (like stamina). Any gear that still shows up after these you can just ignore, even if it does make the Upgrade list take longer, as they would automatically be low in the lists if they were not good for you.",

      "Message": "No, I was saying that the models only including gear with \"relevant\" stats isn't good enough because Stamina is a relevant stat for tanks, so that means that ANY gear that has stamina is considered relevant. BUT, the gear that has Spell Power should NOT be considered relevant.  Similarly Crit is a relevant stat for just about everybody, but rogues aren't going to want to see gear with spell power and/or mp5.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, spell power gear does end up low on the list for tanks, but we aren't talking about a 10% speed increase here. We're talking about a MASSIVE speed difference.  Allowing user filters to be created would also be far more consistent than the model-specific interfaces which for the most part don't even exist and as one person already said, were a pain in the ass to implement.  Stat-based filters however are EASY. I know this because I hacked the xml to add tags. And if I can do it with an external script, Rawr certainly can do it.",
