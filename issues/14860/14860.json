    "Description": "With an open Upgrade List, make the list's window smaller vertically. Scroll down to the bottom items (I had to do this because the set listing was off the bottom of my screen). Then attempt to re-size the List window vertically.\n \nInstead of pulling the upper part of the list back into the pane, the window pulls up white space to fill from the bottom.\n \nLike I said, minor. Hope I described it well enough; if need be, I can show roncli and let him translate it into proper geek-speak.",
