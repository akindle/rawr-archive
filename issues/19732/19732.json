    "Description": "In the WPF version when selecting load from Battle.net when you have unsaved changes it warns that if you click cancel you will need to select from menu again due to Silverlight limitation. However on selecting load from Battle.net again it gives exactly the same warning. \nÂ \nIt appears that the only way to get load from battle.net up again is to say ok to save then cancel the save dialog. Perhaps the warning dialog should just do this ie: display and cancel the save dialog? Bit of a cludge but might work around the Silverlight issue.",
