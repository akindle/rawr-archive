    "Description": "* Description - Rawr does not recognize Silver Inlaid Leaf as having a slot. This results in the Runed Dragonscale (the inscription crafted relic one \"tier\" lower) to be rated higher.\n \n* Steps to Reproduce - \n1) Launch Rawr 4.0.13\n2) Load character into Rawr. (In this case, Paona of Kirin Tor)\n3) Click on Relic slot.\n4) Select Silver Inlaid Leaf\n \n* Version Number/Additional Information - No error message. Rawr v.4.0.13. Noticed several other relics are missing their slots as well. Tried resetting item cache, as well as all caches, no luck. Checked Wowhead, checked Wowarmory, in both instances, both sites registered the presence of a slot.\n \nI'm sorry for not setting the release to 4.0.13, Codeplex's bugtracker confounds me.",

      "Message": "May as well go ahead and close this ticket. I appear to have fixed it by equipping a Silver Inlaid Leaf, with a throwaway gem socketed. Rawr now recognizes the slot, and provides upgrade suggestions accordingly.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the other relics may be fixed in the same fashion, although that may mean it will be a while before these relics are fixed.",
