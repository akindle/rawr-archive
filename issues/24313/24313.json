    "Description": "My mage is on Lightbringer,  Callmetimm.  I have the LFR version of Cha Ye's, The darkmoon faire trinket upgraded twice, and the shadowpan assault trinket.  When I run the optimizer, it is valuing the DMF trinket and the shado pan as my top two to max my dps.  When I equip Cha ye's and Shadow Pan my dps seems to be increased.\n\nIs there an issue with the trinket not modelling correctly?",
