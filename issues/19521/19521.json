    "Description": "I don't believe this to be a problem with rawr at all. I think this has to do with how im configuring rawr for bear tanking. I can't seem to get rawr to recommend dodge at all. All the bear tanks i see are reforging dodge like it was crack cocaine. Anyone see what im doing wrong here?\nÂ \n*Only posting this here because it allows me to attach my config*",

You also should probably set your target damage (raw) to Normal T11 raids.\r\n\r\nThis is personally how I have it set and I have far more threat than I want at times...the other tank in my 10m can't keep things off me if I keep attacking after he taunts.  I have to just kinda stand there.\r\n",
