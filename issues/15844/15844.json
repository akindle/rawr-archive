    "Description": "Playing with the TankDK module last night, I was using the Burst/Reaction graphs trying to optimize my gear around the current hardest hitting boss (Festergut). One thing I noticed that may or may not be an issue for him, but potentially other bosses, is there is no current way to disable parry haste calculations. This leads to a extreme valuation of expertise (which is understandable, if a boss hitting for 125-150k unmitigated is also able to gain parry haste.)\nÂ \nI know with the boss handler on the horizon it won't be an issue, but if it were possible to get something like this in the short term, that could be useful.",
