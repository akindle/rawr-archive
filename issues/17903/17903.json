    "Description": "I've noticed that relative stat values change drastically when Heroism/Bloodlust is enabled under the Spells and Buffs tab. Intellect and spirit take priority over spellpower and crit while haste shows negative scaling. These stat values revert back to reasonable numbers when the heroism option is disabled. It is possible I have overlooked something very important, any feedback regarding this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\nÂ \nEdit: Please ignore previous edit.",

    {
      "Message": "It appears this is a case of incremental optimization overoptimizing. You're in position where you just barely don't need evocation, but more haste would need evocation, and incremental optimization forces it to try to go by without it (which is why you get high value for int/spirit and bad for haste). As a workaround until next version disable incremental optimizations in advanced options.",
