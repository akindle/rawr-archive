      "Message": "I currently have Purified Shard of the Scale on my shaman, which you can select from the list of available trinkets.  But Purified Shard of the Flame can't be selected, even though it is in the database of trinkets.  I tried selecting the Flame trinket on my paladin as well and was unable to do so.  I then tried using a model from scratch, druid bear, and it's not available there either.  This problem seems to be the same for the ilvl 245 Shiny Shard of the Scale/Flame also, as the Flame version of the trinket can't be selected from the list of trinkets.",
