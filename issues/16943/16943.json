    "Description": "Been a couple of versions now, at least .12 and .13, the stats additive buff from Mark of the Wild (and Improved) or the Drums have disappeared from the buff list. Since the +37 int and +37 spirit is nearly more than twice any gemming combo, it might throw off some gearing, or gemming/enchanting.",
