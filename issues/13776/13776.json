    "Description": "The following engineering enchants have changed in value for 3.2 from the values in the Rawr data files for 2.2.11:\nSpringy Arachnoweave (cloak) - Now 27 spellpower (vs old value of 18)\nHyperspeed Accelerators (gloves) - Now 340 haste rating for 12s/1m (vs old duration of 10s/1m)\nNitro Boosts (boots) - Now 24 crit rating (vs old value of 16)\n \nThese are what I noticed for the Mage module. Additionally, the Flexweave Underlay cloak enchant that may be present for melee modules is now 23 Agility instead of a somewhat lower amount pre-3.2.\n \nLooks like the Lightweave Embroidery tailoring enchant to cloak is also unchanged. It is now 295 spellpower instead of 250 (same duration/ICD).",

Am I missing something to get changes to \"stick\" as a workaround until the next release that corrects these?",
