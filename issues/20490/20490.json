    "Description": "I was busy with the optimizer, and part of the optimizations I was busy with were talents.\nUnfortunately, I made a mistake and clicked the \"optimize\" button by accident without selecting anything from the required drop-down field next to the talents. This caused Rawr to produce an error with the attached exception message, and it crashed the program (the program crashed after I managed to get the data copied to the clipboard).\nÂ \nA possible fix might be to put in a check to see that the user has selected an appropriate field when the talents are being optimized? I know that it is the user's fault for the crash, but it might help save some people frustration especially if they were busy with the program for awhile.",
