      "Message": "At least when I looked into the issue - The main wow site is down at the moment.  Your character is on the EU armory yes; however, the base talent spec (before it parses your characters talents) are pulled from there, so it's choking on trying to pull that data.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to time constraints, that code was never rendered safe like the other armory code against the site being down.  It's on my list of tasks though.\r\n\r\nIt should be fine when the site comes back up.",
