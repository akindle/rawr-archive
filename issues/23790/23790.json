    "Description": "i discovered that (in Rawr version 5.0.4) the item filter for world bosses seems to need a small fix. \n\nthe issue being that the upper-tier part of the world bosses list, only has the Sha of Anger listed for it, whereas the lower-tier section that lists Salyis's Warband as a second raid boss, as well. \n\noh and, in case it matters, i am not sure if the correct thing to  add to the pattern second for \"World Bosses\" is \"|Salyis's Warband\" or if it is \"Salyis's Warband|Galleon|Chief Salyis\"... i am leaning towards the first, though.\n\none other thing, i discovered another, separate bug, but due to how unrelated they are, i am gonna make a separate post for it.",
