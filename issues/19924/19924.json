    "Description": "I'm using 4.0.18.0b with the Rawr v0.63 addon.  Initially some of my gear was not found so at some point I also did a \"reload current character from Battlenet\".\n \nThis morning I noticed that I did not have any Prime Glyphs selected under the talents tab so I checked Glyphs of Frostfire, PyroBlast and Living Bomb but it does not seem to have any effect on the stats page (niether the score nor the individual Spell Info change), am I overlooking something?\n \nAlso, I would like to compare the stats for a Frostfire mage (okay, okay I know its not optimal) - what would I have to enter in the customer spell mix to force Rawr to do the calculation based only on the traditional FFBLBPyro rotation ?\n \nmany thanks",
