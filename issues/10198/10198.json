    "Description": "I downloaded b14 yesterday, and have been noticing strange numbers when looking at the DPS charts in Rawr: Mage. For some reason, all the gear values are in the 10s of thousands (looking at head gear for example, the values displayed range from 21800.34 to 55067.94).\n \nI'm not sure what I'm looking at here: are these messed up DPS values (which may be the case, since the DPS value under \"Solution\" is listing at 504,042.40 for a gear set I created for my KZ/ZA mage) or if these are supposed to be some sort of other value (like a gear rating score).\n \nAll the spell-specific info (that found in the \"Spell Info\" section) seems accurate, as spells are in realistic value ranges (such as Fireball displaying a 1209.93 DPS).",
