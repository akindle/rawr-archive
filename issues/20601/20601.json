    "Description": "Defensive stats in Rawr vary from in game stats, in some cases very dramatically.\n \nRawr(4.1.04) Unbuffed:\nStrength: 3308\nArmor: 36029\nDodge: 1922.58\nParry: 2200.75\nMastery: 1909\n \nIn game unbuffed:\nStrength:3268\nArmor: 36356\nDodge: 1089\nParry:2244\nMastery: 1925\n \nUnderstandable of a certain tolerance for error, but something like dodge being that far off can really throw off calculations, especially the parry:dodge ratio for hold the line.",
