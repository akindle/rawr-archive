    "Description": "I'm getting an exception \"Index was outside the bounds of the array.\" in the latest build. It happens in CharacterCalculationsMage.ReconstructSequence\n \n-> double overflow = Solution[ColumnManaOverflow];\n \nColumnManaOverflow is -1 and seems to be only set in the solver if restrictManaUse is true. I didn't look any further in the code. Can provide character .xml if needed.",
