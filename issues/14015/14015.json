    "Description": "Seems the TankDK module is not getting the correct amount of avoidance from agility. The warrior module seems to work OK, so I assume the error is here, rather than in Base. Not got any dev tools available at the moment for debugging though, so can't really check.\nÂ \nIt seems to underrate it by quite a considerable margin, showing Marrowstrike as being less avoidance than Titansteel Destroyer. In game testing shows it to be a good amount more.",

      "Message": "Additionally, weighting values for stats seem to be a bit odd. Looking at stat weights under a default load, stamina is valued as something like 5x less than armor, and also valued at less than health. Which is a bit odd since stamina should be at least 10x the value of health.",
