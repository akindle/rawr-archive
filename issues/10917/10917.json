It probably shouldn't be hard to verify how much value is gained/lost by looking at the dps values and the time each segment would be changed in duration. It is also possible that the value is equivalent, unfortunately the optimizer does not recognize esthetic value in stacking, it just cares about pure damage output.\r\n\r\nI already have it coded to show the sequence in terms of activations instead of which cooldowns are together, I'll see about adding an option to toggle that.\r\n\r\nThe mana overflow indicator applies to the immediate next line. There's nothing you can/should do about it. It basically means that since you start with full mana and activating drums doesn't use any mana you're potentially losing some regen there, but since fire is not mana limited that is not a problem. It's just informative, but seeing something like that in reconstruction of arcane spec sequence could be an indication that the sequence could maybe be further optimized.",

      "Message": "Solmyr, you should use DepthFirst method only if you can't get solution with BestBound one. In general DepthFirst takes more time to prove that the solution is optimal and with a computation limit of 300 it's quite possible that the solutions you're getting were far from optimal. Mouse over the Solution dps, it should tell you how good the solution is. If it's anything like 1% then your computation limit is most likely too low for DepthFirst.\r\n\r\nMain benefit of DepthFirst is that it's a lot more easy on memory consumption. For BestBound with anything like 3k+ coomputation limit it'll start going over 1GB working memory. DepthFirst will let you find optimal solution if you have a lot of time and want true optimal, but even if it stops earlier it will at least give you close to optimal solutions while BestBound wouldn't give you anything useful most likely.\r\n\r\nWith the latest batch of fixes and improvements I was finally able to get a good solution for Twirl's character. This is what I get with somputation limit of 5000:\r\n\r\nINFO: Mana overflow!\r\n00:00.000: Drums of Battle+Activation (10991 mana)\r\n00:01.350: Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+The Skull of Gul'dan+Fireball (10991 mana)\r\n00:06.350: Icy Veins+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+The Skull of Gul'dan+Destruction Potion+Fireball (10773 mana)\r\n00:21.350: Icy Veins+Combustion+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (9752 mana)\r\n00:26.350: Combustion+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (9531 mana)\r\n00:30.000: Combustion+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (9448 mana)\r\n00:33.610: Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (9384 mana)\r\n00:41.350: Flame Cap+Fireball (9174 mana)\r\n01:01.350: Fireball (8631 mana)\r\n02:01.350: The Skull of Gul'dan+Fireball (7002 mana)\r\n02:06.350: Mana Potion (6810 mana)\r\n02:06.350: The Skull of Gul'dan+Fireball (9210 mana)\r\n02:21.350: Drums of Battle+Activation (8633 mana)\r\n02:22.690: Drums of Battle+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (8751 mana)\r\n02:42.690: Drums of Battle+Fireball (8105 mana)\r\n02:51.350: Fireball (7825 mana)\r\n04:49.000: Flame Cap+Fireball (4630 mana)\r\n04:55.300: Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Activation (4459 mana)\r\n04:56.650: Molten Fury+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Fireball (4578 mana)\r\n05:00.000: Molten Fury+Heroism+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (4470 mana)\r\n05:01.150: Molten Fury+Heroism+Combustion+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (4392 mana)\r\n05:05.300: Molten Fury+Heroism+Icy Veins+Combustion+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Fireball (4164 mana)\r\n05:10.300: Molten Fury+Heroism+Icy Veins+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+Hex Shrunken Head+Destruction Potion+Fireball (3750 mana)\r\n05:20.000: Molten Fury+Heroism+Icy Veins+Drums of Battle+Flame Cap+The Skull of Gul'dan+Destruction Potion+Fireball (2817 mana)\r\n05:25.300: Molten Fury+Heroism+Flame Cap+The Skull of Gul'dan+Fireball (2215 mana)\r\n05:40.000: Molten Fury+Flame Cap+Fireball (1107 mana)\r\n\r\nIt's not optimal yet at this computation limit, but it was within 0.18% from upper bound.
