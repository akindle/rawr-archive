      "Message": "Well currently I don't have any real support for movement cycles (currently all the movement parameters are interpreted as out of range to in range movement where you can't attack at all) so it would make more sense to first create support for real inrange movement.",

Rathe101 on EJ posted a link to a spreadsheet which shows it's a dps increase, and that dpm is low enough that it may be an optimal low-mana cycle even without the movement. Unfortunately he's unable to do the math that Rawr.mage does in the solver, so he can't prove it. \r\n\r\nYou can see his spreadsheets here. He's simplified the rotation to just assume 4 scorches for every 1 fireblast.\r\nhttps://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiCFsKWjNGYgdEQ5UU91d2xWQkN0SmVkWW5CLU5NcGc&hl=en&authkey=CKWz6b0C#gid=0",
