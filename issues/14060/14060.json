    "Description": "In 2.2.14, Resilience is being calculated at a ridiculous conversion rate. My Thorim tanking set shows me as having -442% chance to be crit, which is plainly ridiculous. :)  Some poking around with different gearsets, enchants, and the other class models indicates that it's only Resil having this problem (defense seems to be calculated normally) and only for the Bear model (ProtWar/ProtPally/TankDK all do not display this issue).  Also, I verified that this issue is not present in 2.2.13.  Perhaps someone typo'd a decimal point in the Resil calcs somewhere? :)\nÂ \nAttached is my Thorim-tanking character file for easy testing.",
