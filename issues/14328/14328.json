    "Description": "there seems to be some bug in the calculation of the defense rating and/or in \"chance to be crit\". Currently it spits out for me that my defense is 537, but pretends that my chance to be crit is already 0%. The tooltip of \"chance to be crit\" correctly says that I'm only reducing by 4,88%. The issues is that optimizer seems to accept the 537 for crit imunity and results in an \"optiized\" gear which is not really crit imun. I think it should not accept anything less than a defense of 540 to fullfill a chance to be crit < 0% requirement.",

      "Message": "You have \"Use Holy Shield\" checked.  The extra 30% block is pushing critical strikes off your combat table, so with Holy Shield, you will never be crit.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to do to make sure that you're not crit without the holy shield is to set the minimum defense rating in the optimizer to 540 and remove the chance to be crit.",
