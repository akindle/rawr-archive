    "Description": "I was using Rawr v2.3.9 (brilliant program!) and today was asked if I would like to download the update, which I did. However, when I try and load any of my characters from the armory I get the same error message for all of them, this is one error message in full:\n \nStep Name: Get Character\nDescription: Rawr encountered an error retrieving the Character - chiffy@US-Nagrand from the armory\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at Rawr.Armory.GetCharacter(CharacterRegion region, String realm, String name, String[]& itemsOnCharacter)\n \nI can open up saved characters okay. Can you please advise what I'm doing wrong?",
