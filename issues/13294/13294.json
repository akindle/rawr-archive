If my best trinket is in Slot 1 (which it is), shouldn't the items listed in the Upgrade List be compared to my worse trinket, the one in Slot 2?  After all, that's the one I'm going to replace upon getting the new item.  What is happening instead is that the Upgrade List is showing me the value of upgrading my \"better\" trinket, ignoring the worse trinket in slot 2.",
