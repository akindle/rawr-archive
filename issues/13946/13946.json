    "Description": "As the title says, the feral cat ability Berserk is only counted once regardless of the fight duration set. Berserk is treated as a source of energy at lines 109-110 in \"CatRotationCalculator.cs\". The fix is to simply update line 110, using a similar approach as done with Tiger's Fury two lines above, to take into account the fact that Berserk is available every 180s.",
