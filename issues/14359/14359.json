    "Description": "Previous versions I saw Thunderstrike (correctly imo) returned in Ony loot.  It no longer does so on refresh.  It's summoned from the true drop Shadowstrike but should probably have some sort of code workaround for the strange mechanic.\nÂ \nAlso, why isn't the source field user editable? I could work around it by copy/pasting into said field.  I suppose I could try to find it in the item cache xml too but...",
