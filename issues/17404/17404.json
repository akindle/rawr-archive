    "Description": "Could we please get support for Glowing Dreadstone (12sp, 15sta) added to the elemental model? Right now, it only has support for the Royal Dreadstone (12sp, 5mp5) and really.. elemental shaman have no need for mp5. I'd much rather have more health to soak up more damage so that I might live to actually, you know, dps and do my job. Right now, the Glowing Dreadstone is only listed as 12sp with no sta and I can't even find it in Rawr3 to be able to add it manually to an item instead of the Royal Dreadstone. I could just be looking in the wrong place for it, however.",
