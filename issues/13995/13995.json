    "Description": "How do I delete the optimizer item list?\nI tried to create a set for my prot warrior, but I couldn't find a way to remove the optimizer item list from my mage\nIn the end, I ended up redownloaded Rawr to get rid of the item list, but shouldn't there be a way to remove it in the program itself?\n \nAnd if there's a possibility to do that, wouldn't it be a good idea to add that to the Tour of Rawr video about the optimizer?\n \nEdit: hope I posted this in the correct section, I'm a bit new to Rawr",
