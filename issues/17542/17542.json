    "Description": "Item #50352 is a 264 trinket used by tank specs.  It is inappropriately evaluating in Rawr as much worse than it is because the stats don't include the melee attack proc when you're below 35% health.  This trinket is especially good for tanking Festergut as he often reduces the tank to low life.",
