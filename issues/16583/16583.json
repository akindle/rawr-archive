    "Description": "As you can see from the attached screen shot, the overall numbers in the status bar at the bottom of the window should reflect accurate DPS and Survivability. Based upon the numbers under \"Basic Stats\" i.e. Ranged attack power: 7185, Hit: 271, Crit: 48.58, the calculated numbers in version 2.3.11 should be close to the numbers reported in 2.3.10.\n \nI've been a long term user of RAWR and gone through the following steps to ensure I'm setup correctly.\n \n1. Updated the item cache from the Armory\n2. Updated the item cache from wowhead.com\n3. Confirmed that I'm loading my Survival Hunter spec from the Armory\n4. Confirmed that the talents tab reflects the currect spec\n5. Configured all relevent buffs (Basically all self buffs). I've been doing it that way for almost a year.\n6. Left the Basics setting alone under the Options tab\n7. Ensured the \"Survival\" Hunter Shot Priority was selected and confirmed the shots listed\n8. Selected my wolf under Pet Talents\n9. Applied appropriate buffs under Pet Buffs\n \nHowever, When I select Calculate under the Details tab, nothing happens.\n \nI have attempted to re-install, and reload the application with no change.",
