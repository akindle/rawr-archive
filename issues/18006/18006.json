    "Description": "For some reason if I try to build an upgrade list, either through the optimize or \"Load possible upgrades from Wowhead\" both in the tools menu, it runs its course then at 100% the results window disappears and if i run it again the same thing happens.\nÂ \nI apologize if this has been asked before but would it be possible to choose which settings we would like to import the data from wow as all items are available for optimization? I am using the rpgo-Character profiler.",

Load possible upgrades from wowhead just updates the item cache. The Build Upgrade List window comes up with a result but if you are in Windows Vista/7 you may have to use Alt-Tab to find it. Your other paragraph doesn't make sense.",
