    "Description": "Would it be possible to include a simple WoW-Addon that exports bag and bank contents to an XML file for import into Rawr? This would make keeping the items available ingame and the Rawr lists in sync much easier imho. Are there any addons that already can do item list exports?",

So I propose adding an option \"Import items from CharacterProfiler\" which only updates which items are available, but leaves everything else untouched, meaning I could update from armory, then update items from CharacterProfiler to get a complete representation of my current ingame status.",
