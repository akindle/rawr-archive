    "Description": "Just downloaded 2.3.14, loaded up my mage, switched a few gems and noticed it started showing survivability, and not dps.   Reloading rawr and/or changing modules to something else and back to mage fixes it, but not for long.  The second I start messing around with gear/gems/enchants/talents, it switches to survivability for no reason, and I cant see my dps.",
