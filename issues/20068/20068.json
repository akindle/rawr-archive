    "Description": "The tool tip for damage taken displays (on my toon) 35728 normal attack, 25010 blocked attack. This is a 30% reduction but due to paladin talents we get an additional 10% for a total of 40% reduction. This could be why mastery is not being charted as the best stat for us with build Rawr 4.0.20 (Feb 20, 2011) [r58200].",
