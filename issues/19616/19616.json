    "Description": "This was a nice option in Rawr2 that I used.     Failing that it would be nice to maybe have a list of the last few characters saved appear under the \"open saved character\" button in the welcome screen.\n \nOne other (very small) thing, it makes more sense to me (and perhaps only me) to have the buttons read :-\n \nImport from Battle.net\nImport from Rawr addon\nLoad saved character\n \ninstead of \n \nLoad from Battle.net\nLoad from Rawr addon\nOpen saved character\n \n \nProbably just me though :)",
