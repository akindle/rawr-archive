    "Description": "34. On physical attacks, Hurricane acts like a regular 1 PPM enchant. On spells, it is a 45 second ICD and a 15% proc rate. If a spell proc occurs while a melee proc is active, it will refresh the melee proc. If a spell proc occurs with no melee proc, it will create a separate stack of the buff, potentially resulting in 3 stacks being up at the same time.\n46. Avalanche does not benefit from Bandit's Guile. It seems likely that DMC does not either.\n47. Avalanche procs off weapon attacks with a 5 PPM proc rate, and has a 10% chance to proc off Deadly Poison or Rupture ticks. It does not appear to proc off Instant Poison or Venomous Wounds. Triggering ticks can proc an Avalanche enchant on either hand, however it appears that dual-wielding Avalanche does not increase the proc rate.\nÂ \nSource: http://elitistjerks.com/f78/t105429-cataclysm_mechanics_testing/",
