    "Description": "When I am looking for upgrades for a Shadow Priest I notice DPS Tier 9 Gear is worse than the Healing T9 Gear.  I even equipped a weapon with no hit to make sure it was not because of hit but when \"Zabra's Mantle of Conquest\" (DPS) is near the bottom of the list with a 221.56 vs \"Zabra's Shoulderpads of Conquest\" (Healing) near the top of the list with a 390.20 i would say something is wrong. the only t9 gear i have set is \"Zabra's Circlet of Conquest\" (DPS) on the head which means I should get the 2 piece of t9 gear bonus and make the DPS set much better.",
