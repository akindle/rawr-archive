    "Description": "I'm mage, Rawr doesn't recognize my head enchant Arcanum of Burning Mysteries.\n \nAfter I set this on my head gear and try to optimize, it shows me an Optimazer warning saying that there was no enchant head selected (even when it does), so I click on continue with the optimization.  After that another warning message appears: The fallowing currently equipped items are not available: Arcanum of Burning Mysteries is not available.  So the final result is an optimized gear that has no head enchant and has a lower dps.\n \nWhat can I do to set this properly so it recognize this enchant?",
