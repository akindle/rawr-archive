    "Description": "Using Rawr3 on a Mac. Loaded a warlock from the armory. Model correctly lists as Warlock, but class defaults to Druid (remains unchanged from whatever class was last loaded). Second pane shows only the default model or whatever model was last loaded. Attempting to Optimize causes a hang.\nÂ \nGut simply says it's not in yet, but it needs an issue, so that the issue can be closed later.",
