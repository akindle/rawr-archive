    "Description": "Dunno what exactly you guys did recently to mess with relevancy, but it looks like you forgot to apply base.IsItemRelevant(item) or something, cause it's showing all sorts of items that it shouldn't (like DK-specific items). Also, if you're going to have a 'Hide bad items' checkbox, make sure that there's a tooltip on it, explaining exactly what it's hiding, and try not to overlap with the built in 'refine types of items listed' feature.",

I also didn't notice any items that would be for like DK's or anything showing up where it wouldn't have otherwise, I'll double-check it. Turning it off uses original default behavior, at least it should be.",
