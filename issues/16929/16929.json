Creating your own filter is easy enough, but creating it every time a new version is release makes it a bit of an annoyance.",

      "Message": "You shouldn't really need to filter gems at all.\r\n\r\nThe model itself should take care of filtering out any gems who's stats aren't relevant to the model (such as Def and SP gems for melee). Every gem having modelled stats should be available via the custom gemming. It's possible the model is doing something wrong and isn't following filtersettings or options properly.  If this is the case, you should open an issue for that specifically (and mention which model you have a problem with).\r\n\r\nNormal gem availability on items should be handled via the gemming templates.\r\n\r\nIf you need to continuously change the gemming templates each version, then either you're doing it wrong, or you should open an issue for the model to provide a better set of default gemming templates.",

Currently, if you don't have the \"other\" filter checked, no gems show up at all.\r\nYou go gems=>red or whatever and nothing shows up at all.    So if you want to mark gems as available (or indeed equip a custom gemming) you have to go into the filters and tick the \"other\" box to be able to do it.\r\n\r\n",

For what you describe, you should definitely be just disabling the offending gemming templates, and leaving 'consider active hemming templates blah blah' on. ",
