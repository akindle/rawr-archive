    "Description": "The easiest example is Inscribed Loop of Kirin Tor (item=45689) being show with overall optimizer value of 1158.54 while its direct upgrade, better in every stat, Etched Loop of the Kirin Tor (item=48955) is shown with only an overall optimizer of 927.27.  The main difference is in heal sustained which is 896.39 for inscribed and 575.09 for the Etched.  All of the stat values are correct for both rings, and i did upgrade from wowhead.  The calculation is still obviously wrong.",

      "Message": "Okay, this appears to be directly related to my saved char file.  I could recreate the file from scratch, add all the same gear, set all the options the same way and could never recreate it.  As painful as it is to go through and add the ton o gear and specs i bounce between, I will probably start regularly doing so.  I have attached the bad file, maybe someone else can figure out exactly why it is causing items to be calculated incorrectly.",
