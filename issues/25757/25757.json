    "Description": "I used to use Rawr all the time years ago for setting up my tank perfectly. I have recently gotten back in to it and to my amazement, Rawr was still available.  I downloaded it, ran it and..........holy crap, what a PoS. Huge system hog! If I can get things to run at all, it takes forever. Please tell me you guys have a fixed version on the way. I can't believe that this was made available to the public in the state it is in. I understand that you might be short handed and you might be in need of funds to have people work on it, but man, turning out quality like this will keep people form coming back to get any upgraded versions. Please tell me there is a fixed version coming soon......please.",
