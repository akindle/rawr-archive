      "Message": "It looks like this also affects hit, by the way.\r\n\r\nI think I see what's going on. The relative stat values page works by making an item with, e.g. 1 crit rating, and calculating how much more DPS you get out of that. But your simulation algorithm is more or less discrete with regard to hit and crit -- you need to crit with one additional spell, or miss with one additional spell, for the final DPS value to change. So \"small\" changes in crit don't affect the simulation.\r\n\r\nYou can verify this by taking an item, and adding 1, 10, 100, 1000 crit rating in succession; it'll stay constant for a while, and then go up all at once.\r\n\r\nI think some of the other models calculate damage as crit% * avgCritDamage + non-crit%* avgNonCritDamage, so that even a slight increase in crit chance leads to a slight increase in overall DPS.\r\n\r\nThis could be completely wrong, of course, but it seems to be what's happening.",
