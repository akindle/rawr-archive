    "Description": "Items not Being Ranked correctly IE Pants from WOTK are showing up as higher DPS then pants from Cata (keep in mind the differences between the two items is 93 hit on the ones from WOLK {and if you're hit caped thats not going to do anything for you} and the ones from Cata has 3x more Intel {witch Equals more Spell Power} and 2x more Stam) \n \nAlso it's Missing the Buff Dark Intent for the warlocks ( It Vary In-portent to a warlocks dps) \n \nthere is also a big problem with the rotation system... every time i try to put in the rotation that i use it Crashes with a Stack over flow .... the Rotation that i use that gets me close to 13k dps:  COD, COE, Demon soul, Immolate, Configulate, Corruption, Chaos Bolt, (use incinerate for for filler), Fel Fire then repeat from configulate",
