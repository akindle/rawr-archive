    "Description": "While I appreciate all the hard work and effort that has gone into making both of these, it seems that the two do not always play nice with each other. From reading the Issues Tracker as well as the Discussions, I would like to make the following suggestion:\n \nIf something changes in Rawr.Base that requires a particular change in Rawr.Addon or (has is the case currently) if something in Addon requires changes in Base then please release both sets of changes concurrently. \n \nRight now Rawr.Base .14 doesn't not work (or only works sometimes) with Rawr.Addon .51 and from what I can tell we are simply awaiting Rawr.Base .15 to be released.",

      "Message": "Whilst the addon is very new I've done massive amounts of updating adding big new features every other day. I've put out new versions so beta testers can find bugs and give feedback. In particular in these very early days where I am working on importing and exporting data from Rawr. There have been LOTS of changes to the data being exported and imported. This has meant that the version of Rawr that is live on the website was out of date. However rather than updating the website every other day its updated every other week. Thus during this early period in the addons existence the two got out of sync.\r\n\r\nNow that the data exchange between Rawr and the addon has largely settled down there should no longer be an issue with them getting out of sync. HOWEVER if we add a new feature that requires a change it will get out of sync again. Such is life. Hopefully any such out of sync is a very shortlived issue.",
