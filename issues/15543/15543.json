    "Description": "Currently when loading from CharacterProfiler, the user only has the option to load the full character. When this is done, the currently loaded character gets put to the side and the new import becomes the working character. The request is to make an option of only loading the items the user has available to them, from their bank and such, into the already open character as available items. This would then allow the user to keep the settings, equipment, etc that they have configured for that currently loaded character and add new data in the form of items they have in-game to it, then save it.",

      "Message": "@Astrylian, nope.. cause that over-rides other things. Namely it over-rides the equipped gear/enchants. Scenario: I have a level 80 Tree that's doing it's thing, but I'm planning on switching over or dual speccing into Bear when I can acquire some gear for each slot. So, I make a Bear character in Rawr to serve as a gear plan, where I can have a version of the character as it will be when it reaches the proper state for being a Bear. If I use the character profiler reload, it loads my tree gear into the Bear slots. However, if there's an option for only loading available gear (what's in my personal bank, inventory and mail), then I can quickly see if any of my old Cat gear is worth using for my Bear character. Not only that, I can start getting pieces for Bear and placing them in my bank as I work the Tree angle. Instead of having to go through the lists of gear and mark each new piece I acquire and place in my bank, I could have this done through character profiler a lot smoother. I think this makes dual-spec planning a lot easier. Hope that makes sense.",
