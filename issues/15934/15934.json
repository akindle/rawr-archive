    "Description": "http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=22418707360&pageNo=6#103\n \nBornakk:\nWe changed the way PPM procs work to make sure many of the weapons and trinkets did their expected performance in Icecrown instead of proc'ing too much for some specs or classes or forcing players into unusual behavior to try and fish for the procs. This change also affected some older mechanics in the game too such as the Berserking enchant. For the most part the intent is that these systems all proc off of attacks and they are balanced with that assumption.\n \nAt this time we're happy with the damage that characters are now doing after these changes, though we'll continue to monitor and adjust damage overall and that includes the proc-based items. \n \n \n \n \nJust wanted to make sure everyone was aware of this. I'm sure the individual model managers are either on top of it or will get to it when they can. Toodles.",
