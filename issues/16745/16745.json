    "Description": "The 2 piece bonus for Koltira's Plate or Thassarian's Plate does not seem to be properly implemented: It shows up in the tooltip as \"0.05 Bonus Blood Strike Damage / 0.05 Bonus Heart Strike Damage\" and is ranked as adding near-zero value as a buff under Buffs > Set Bonuses. This should be a 5% increase in Blood/Heart Strike damage, but it seems to be implemented as a microscopic amount of bonus damage.\nÂ \nOf course, without the ability to poke around in set bonuses like we can items, it's difficult for me as an end user to identify exactly how this set bonus is calculated. I may be completely wrong in how this is intended to work.",

      "Message": "Thanks! And yeah a lot of tanking bonuses I've seen are pretty lackluster, like the 2T10 bonus for druids. Sure, Swipe doing 20% extra damage is good for AoE threat... but that's generally on trash and I haven't needed a lot of help on AoE threat on my bear anyway--and just exactly how much of Lacerate's threat is the actual damage? Not a lot, I heard... though honestly the 4T10 bonuses are insanely good for both cat and bear. An extra mitigation cooldown? Rake critting?! Yes please. >:3",

      "Message": "Welll, all 4 tanking specs, the 4-piece is similart to one another. but yea, the 2 piece is mostly a threat increase (marginal but an increase) and the 4-piece is an extra cd we can work with. Especially useful on LK.",
