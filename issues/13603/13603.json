      "Message": "It's modeled incorrectly. It loads with an Old Equipment Proc, and an incorrect one, at that (states 300 mana 5% chance). Try changing the value - it's only calculating the effect of Intellect by default. I removed that effect and replaced it with a Special Effect 600 Mana Restore (10% on SpellCast/45 Sec) and it calculates much more accurately.",

This is the new WotlK gem.\r\n\r\nThe old gem, Insightful Earthstorm Diamond has no \"new\" proc, that is correct. This is the old TBC gem.\r\n\r\nShould probably make a new issue and write in Insightful Earthstorm Diamond (TBC Gem).",
