    "Description": "It appears that the Optimizer is not using items that are unavailable due to the \"refine types of items listed\" even if they are marked as available for optimizer.\n \nSpecific case:\nMoonkin has both \"Meteor Chaser's Rainments\" and \"Vestments of Spruce and Fir\" selected as available.  Under Refine Types of Items listed, \"Cloth\" is de-selected.  Running the optimizer, it choose Vestments (leather) as best option for chest.  Selecting Gear Slot: Chest on the right pane shows the cloth (Meteor) as being better. \n \nSelecting cloth in the Refine Items and re-optimizing choose Meteor as a better chest.",
