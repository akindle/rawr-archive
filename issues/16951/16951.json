    "Description": "For some reason when I build a new upgrade list it's only giving me 3 total items on the list (2 weapons and a helmet). I've built many upgrade lists but for someone reason either with this version (2.3.12) or the last version the feature isnt working properly. It should, at the very least, include all the 277 versions of the gear I'm already wearing since those pieces are obvious upgrades but they aren't on the list. I'm not filtering out any items either, they're are shown in the main gear comparison area of the application. It's frustrating to spend 30 minutes building a new upgrade list to find only 3 items on it. I'm geared but not that geared.",
