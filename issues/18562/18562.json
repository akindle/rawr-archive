How do you expect me to reproduce your exact issue without YOUR information at the TIME THE ISSUE OCCURRED. This is why we ask for the file.\r\n\r\nI don't know where you are getting this -192/125 from yet, but I'm looking into it. I'd guess that since the /125 is half of the 250 you multiple both of those by 2 for 384/250 which would lead me to believe that the formula you actually wanted to convery (but did a really bad job of comparing it in your image) was 'Crit = (AGI * 3 - 384) / 250' which would imply that the first 384 Agility doesn't give Crit. But I have no source to back that up right now.",
