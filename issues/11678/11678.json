    "Description": "I was just curious about getting an installer file (MSI or something like that). I would love to start testing this on Codeweavers Crossover for Mac, but since it doesn't have an installer, Crossover can't take the Rawr.exe and make a .APP out of it. I know I could use Mono, but it tends to hang my MBP, and booting into VMWare is not very efficient since it takes way too much memory and CPU time. \nÂ \nThanks,",
