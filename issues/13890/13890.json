First, the enchant dropdown on each item slot.  Second, the right-hand-panel (Comparison), dropdown for Slot: Enchants->(slot name).\nScreenshots attached.",

      "Message": "I have narrowed down the symptoms.  Equipping only certain helms will cause these symptoms.\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1.  Load my model from armory, Profess on Ysera.\r\n2.  Click any enchant dropdown.  Notice the value of the currently-equipped enchant.\r\n3.  Change my helm to \"Empty\" or equip most any other helm.\r\n4.  Observe that the values of currently-equipped enchants now display as expected.\r\n5.  Restore the Conqueror's Circlet of Sanctification.\r\n6.  Observe that currently-equiped enchant values on all items (i.e. gloves, boots, weapon) are now displayed wrong.\r\nSince getting rid of the Conqueror's Circlet of Sanctification fixes the problem, I tested many other helms on the list.  The following break the modelling:\r\n* Conqueror's Circlet of Sanctification\r\n* Hood of Smoldering Aftermath\r\n* Hood of Fiery Aftermath\r\n(may be more, only test equipped the top 40 helm comparisons)\r\nThis seems to be restricted to the ShadowPriest modelling rather than the items themselves, as switching to the HolyPriest model while equipping the 3 broken helms does not reproduce the problem.",
