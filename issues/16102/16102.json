    "Description": "I'm not sure if this is an enhancement specific issue, but the proc rate on Black Bruise has not been updated to reflect the recent buff. Testing in this thread http://elitistjerks.com/f79/t82621-enhsim_updated_thread/p9/ determined a 3.3% proc rate. It's easy enough to change the item properties manually, but it should probably be updated. Also, the heroic version has no proc on it at all. Again, simple enough to add in by hand. \nÂ \nOn a related note, the item's dps is a bit low in Rawr compared to EnhSim. 251 weapons are all showing as better than 264 BB in Rawr whereas EnhSim shows it as a decent amount higher.",
