    "Description": "I'm trying to use the Optimize feature in b5, and it consistently hangs on the \"equip the findings\" stage. Optimization itself completes OK, but I can't see it's results :) This happens regardless of whether I select Override reenchant/regem and regardless of the thoroughness I set.\nÂ \nI'm using WinXP Home. Please let me know how can I provide more information for you to be able to understand the problem.",

So given the fact that I have no error message for you and you can't reproduce the problem on your end, I guess this issue is a dead end - feel free to close :) The only inference to make is that for some reason \"inherited\" profile might not work sometimes.",
