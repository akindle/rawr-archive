    "Description": "I have a fury warrior with Titan's Grip; MH is currently Aesir's Edge and OH is currently Ironsoul; I have configured Rawr to let it know that I have .  When selecting the \"Optimize\" command, Rawr assumes that I have two Aesir's Edge and gives me a (nonsensical) optimization by placing an extra one in the OH slot.  I assume this is due to the linkage between the available weapons in the MH and those in the OH...i.e. I cannot make only Aesir's Edge available to the MH and Ironsoul to the OH to counter this (and if I uncheck the available weapons in the list I get an error).",
