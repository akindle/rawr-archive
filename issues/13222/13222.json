    "Description": "I searched through the Discussions and found 1 other post from feb mentioning this but it seams that agi for ret paladins (or maybe paladins in general) is being calculated at 62.5 AGI per 1% crit instead of 52.083333 AGI per 1% crit like its meant to be. Don't know if it is already known so i thought i would point it out. The post also mentioned that he was able to change his local version of RAWR to the right ratio. if someone could tell me how to do that it would be much appreciated.",
