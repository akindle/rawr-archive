    "Description": "If you import a character from battle.net, save file, modify it, try to save again, it still works as \"Save As\" asking me to enter file name. Only after I have opened the saved file, the \"Save\" starts working correctly. It kind of needs to remember to what file I saved the current character after save as also, not only after opening file.\nÂ \nAlso if you open file A.xml, Save as to file B.xml (also changing current work file one might assume), simple \"Save\" again (not Save As) one might think the last save went to file B.xml, but in fact it overwrites the original file A.xml.",
