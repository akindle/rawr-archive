      "Message": "Is there somewhere convenient to find out the internal cooldowns and proc chances?  Rawr is usually where I go to find them out, so I don't know where else to look.  The previous build, which I was using up until this morning (Hi Jothay), had the regular Hymnal modeled, but not the Heroic, so I just copied the proc chance and the CD.  This build has neither modeled, and I don't remember the numbers.  In fact, of the four Cata trinkets I own, none of them have their procs modeled.",
