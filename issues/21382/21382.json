    "Description": "I've ran the program on my mage and had great results. However, when trying to load my hunter, it get's all screwy. I get this...\n \nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n \nNo Suggested Fix\n \n   at Rawr.Hunter.StatsHunter.Accumulate(StatsHunter data, Single weight)\n   at Rawr.Hunter.CalculationsHunter.GetSpecialEffectsStats(Character Char, Dictionary`2 triggerIntervals, Dictionary`2 triggerChances, StatsHunter statsTotal, StatsHunter statsToProcess)\n \nAnd this is, I assume, unlimited. That is to say that when I close the error window, and Identical one pops up. This happens on load. I have clicked about thirty time and it will stop. After that, if I click on ANYTHING useful, say an gem in helm to see where it rates, the window is back, and will not leave even if I keep closing it. Tried for almost four solid minutes, and that's a LOT of windows. Any ideas?\n \n \n**** From \"Copy to Clipboard ****\n \nI have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily. **** (minor additional notation, there WAS no suggested fix) ****\n \n== Version: 4.2.4.0 ==\n \n== Error Message ==\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at Rawr.Hunter.StatsHunter.Accumulate(StatsHunter data, Single weight)\n   at Rawr.Hunter.CalculationsHunter.GetSpecialEffectsStats(Character Char, Dictionary`2 triggerIntervals, Dictionary`2 triggerChances, StatsHunter statsTotal, StatsHunter statsToProcess)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\n[Please fill in steps here]",
