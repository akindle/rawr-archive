    "Description": "I download the new rawr, and its very slow. When i do optimization it takes for ever now. I have used several versions now and never came across how slow its running. Even tried to re-download and not change any settings and still is very slow on optimizing.  Was wondering if anyone else noticed or any thing on my end might be messing with it.",

Enough that I am a lot more ruthless in de-greendiamonding more gear that I am \"fairly\" sure won't ever be used.    Certainly having all my feral gear marked and then optimising for bear & kitty with the same file is no longer an option for me.\r\n\r\n",
