    "Description": "Agi gives quite a lot of dodge to paladins.\n \nWith kings, the 22agi enchant on cloak should give the same as 18.3 dodge rating, yet it is rated as worse than the 12dodge rating enchant for mitigation.\n \nI think the crit and armour values are correct.\n \nAgi should give 1% dodge per 48 agi for paladins (with kings) I think? Something like that anyway.\n \nAt the moment its hardly giving any dodge at all!",
