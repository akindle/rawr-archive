    "Description": "When I try to start the latest version (v4.0.02) and try to load a character either from a file or battle.net, the program crashes with an error. I'm not sure what the error is however since no details are given.  When I go back to v4.0.01 it works fine.\nÂ \nAttached is the character file as well as the same character I tried to pull from battle.net. I did try to open another character (a pally and a mage) and that worked fine.  I opened another warrior character from battle.net in my guild and that worked fine as well.  I'm not too sure where the problem might be.",
