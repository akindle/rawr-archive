    "Description": "Description:\nIn the previous version of Rawr there is the ability to sort gear lists (in the right panel) by 'Overall', 'Burt dps', 'sustained dps', or tanking values for tank specs. This has not been implemented in the Silverlight version. It is a really useful feature.\nThe lack of this option is making gear choices harder for moonkins, where I have found that sorting for burst dps and basing gear choices on that to work well. Looking at tanking trinkets based on the different tank values is useful too.\nÂ \nSuggestion:\nCan you port this feature from the older version?",

      "Message": "In this case I was talking specifically about the moonkin model. I have been using these stats to make up for the fact that the model favours mana regen stats too highly. I have also changed the options to significantly reduce the combat time of the model (down to about 3 minutes from 5) so that the pure dps pieces are ranked higher (which gets around the need to sort by burst dps). Mana regeneration has never been an issue in any ICC fight, and the defaults in the model are suggesting spirit/mp5 pieces over pure dps pieces.\r\n\r\nThat said, I use this sort as a Bear tank as well. I find it useful to occasionally sort by Mitigation or Survival rather than Overall. Not nearly as often as the Moonkin model though.\r\n\r\nPart of this is usability. While the options tab can be used to tweak the calculations, it is not obvious to all users. I know quite a few people who struggle to understand why they need to do that and not use the defaults. I sat down with 2 people recently at work and explained how to make Rawr work they way they wanted. Answering the question \"Why is the heals cloth piece ranked higher than the piece with hit rating on it? I need hit and not mana regen.\" is not simple, and the sort used to allow a quick resolution to the problem.\r\nWithout the sort the answer becomes \"Go to the options and make the boss fight shorter if you never have mana problems.\", which is harder to do.\r\n\r\nI hope the context helps here.",

      "Message": "Sorting by the different subpoints is definitely supported. Burst DPS just isn't going to be a subpoint anymore.\r\n\r\nIf there's some issue with the Moonkin calculations that make it think you need more mana than you do, that's what needs to be fixed.",
