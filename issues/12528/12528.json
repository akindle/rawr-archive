I checked the Edit Items section and it has 90% of the idols listed in the Item Database, but only around 5 display in the actual ranged item selection for druids.",

It's great for threat generation, I'm just surprised that most of them are filtered out while there are caster items that are not filtered out in the other gear slots. Once I get off work I could take a look at the rest of the idols and see what else stands out as relevant for the bear model but is currently filtered.",

      "Message": "The specific idol I'm interested in is the Idol of Perspicacious Attacks (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=38365), which can't apparently be modeled because the idol grants a constant amount of bonus damage to a bear's Maul and Swipe, neither of which are configurable attributes of items (at least as far as I can see). Given this should (I'm guessing) have a positive effect on a bear's numbers, it'd be worth being able to add to the model.",
