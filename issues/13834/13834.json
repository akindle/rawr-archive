My guess is that there was originally one item, the ilvl 258 one, and they split it into two, because there's also a Belt of the Tenebrous Mist that has the same exact stats and slots as the ilvl 258. \r\n\r\nOne remaining thing seems to be wrong in Rawr. It says the ilvl 245 version drops in 10m Trial of the Crusader, but even on the Armory it says it drops in 25m.",
