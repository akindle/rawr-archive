    "Description": "There are a few subtle differences between Rawr and Aldriana's Combat Sheet, and also some major ones.  A few of the subtle one's I've noticed is that Rawr would tell me to use Precious's Putrid Collar and the Chestguard of the Frigid Noose (251 level for both) over Wodin's Lucky Necklace and the Shadow Seekers Tunic (both 264).  The gemmings were pretty much the same, which I was excited to see.  The major difference I noticed is that Rawr had a low-rupture cycle coming out about 1000 DPS ahead of an Evis-Only cycle, and Aldriana's Combat Spreadsheet had a low-rupture cycle coming in about 50 DPS BEHIND an Evis-Only cycle.  To check this on Aldriana's Sheet, you'll need to change the talent specs in the Combat tree to put 3 points in Ruthlessness, 2 in Blood Splatter, and 0 in Imp Evis, and then change the Evis Glyph to Glyph of Rupture.  \nÂ \nOne other thing I noticed was that Rawr was putting Glyph of Adrenaline Rush above Glyph of Rupture in a low-rupture spec, whereas Aldriana's Sheet had Glyph of Rupture higher.  Not sure where Rawr puts Glyph of AR in an Evis-Only spec.",
