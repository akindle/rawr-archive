    "Description": "I had mentioned this problem back in v2.2.15 as part of the Vampiric Embrace item ( http://rawr.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=14087 ) but that item was closed due to Vampiric Embrace being fixed.\n \nWhen you take all of the talent points out of \"Pain and Suffering\" your DPS increases by almost 25%.  Unless I am missing something, Shadow Word: Pain staying on the target without having to waste time recasting it should not be able to lower your DPS.\n \nAlso, once you have removed all points from \"Pain and Suffering,\" if you then remove all points from \"Improved Mind Blast\" you get another 10% DPS increase.  Being able to cast Mind Blast more often, whether you choose to or not should also not be able to lower your DPS.\n \nI have attached a sample Shadow Priest character file created with v2.2.16 which demonstrates the problem.",
