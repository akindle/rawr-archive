      "Message": "I have the general damages nerfed in my local build. What I'm trying to do is the updated health values for all of the bosses before I post. Considering the guild I'm in is 6/7 HM 25-man, and our alt group (with the latest nerfs) is 3/7 HM 10man, I have the health values for most of the hard mode bosses. I'm just missing a few of the normal bosses:\r\n\r\nShannox - Just missing 25-man normal + Rage/rip's health\r\nAlysrazor - Missing 25-man normal, 10-man heroic\r\nBethtilac - Missing 25-man normal\r\nLord Rhyolith - Missing 25-man normal\r\nBaleroc - Missing 25-man normal\r\nMajordomo - Missing 25-man normal\r\nRagnaros - Missing 10-man heroic\r\n\r\nNow half of these I will probably be able to get a hold of tomorrow on my druid (kitty stealth ftw), however Alysrazor, Majordomo, Rag, and maybe Shannox (depending on when our Raid leader decides to switch to heroic raid mode) I will probably not get. But once I get Beth, Baleroc, and Rhyolith tomorrow, I'll post an update.\r\n",
