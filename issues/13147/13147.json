      "Message": "Found in build 33645 and earlier:\r\nUnable to use Wound/Wound (And poisons do not appear to be working of the normalized proc per minute).  I can only get wound to work correctly if I put deadly in my mainhand.\r\nOne of the parts of HAT is using Hemo when combo points are too low.  While the current implementation of HAT is actually pretty close to what's needed, could another box be added next to it with average Hemo's a minute?  Hemo is used when you have a bad group composition and have to fight for your combo points while waiting for HAT to kick in to 5.\r\nAlso, being able to see the energy return from Ruthlessness would be nice HAT wise as well, since that can be 1k energy a fight or more.\r\n\r\n",

I'll see about adding the PPM\r\nI'll add the ruthlessness & Hemo requests next",
