    "Description": "In version 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 I have problems with building an upgrade list for my fury warrior.  When I click the Build Upgrade List button on the Optimize screen it will start building the list but then freeze during processing.\nÂ \nIt does not happen everytime and might not happen if the thoroughness is really low.  However, I had it freeze at lower thouroughness as well.  About 75% of the time it will freeze on me and I have to kill the application.  \nI am running Rawr in Windows Vista.",
