    "Description": "I'm trying the Tree model and the whole gear least on the right only shows the blue part of the graph, which is MP5. Even though the Sort os set to Overall, it does not take HpS, Survival and ToL in consideration. if I sort by HpS, the sort seemsto work fine, but no graph bars are shown at all.\nÂ \nHas anyone successfully managed to use the Tree model?",

      "Message": "Until you set up your talents, buffs, enchants, and most of your gear it likely will only show mp5 due to the fact you would run oom given the rotation it tries to set up for a 5 minute fight. This particular class/spec can be very specific as to how differences in time on a fight will affect it, as well as the spells being cast. It can really only be trusted for a guideline considering different situations will call for different spell usage, and I don't believe it accounts for Swiftmend which is generally a \"crap this person is low\" button.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to see healing worth but are starting with a fresh template and don't want to search out all your items and enchants beforehand, set the Fight Length in Options to 1.5 minutes and healing will show nice and early.\r\n",
