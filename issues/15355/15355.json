    "Description": "Description: From previous versions of 2.3.0 and earlier, there was requirement if you didn't reach 8% hit rate with talents + hit gear/gem. The ranking of items/enchants that favor \"Hit\" would be ranked higher in \"Overall\" DPS. Since 2.3.1 it seems that no matter what I do with it's still saying pure Red gems are higher DPS which is not true if you are not \"Hit\" cap.\n \nSteps To Reproduce:\n \n1) Launch Rawr\n \n2) Load a Hunter from wowarmory with low hit cap not 8%\n \n3) Look at gear being gem for pure Red gems versus \"Hit Gems\" in yellow slots.\n \n4) Compare with 2.3.0 has the correct analysis of how \"Hit\" should affect DPS.\n \nAdditional Information;\nRawr v2.3.1 Only",

I have noticed what you mention in that Hit has gone down in value with recent commits but I'm not entirely certain that it's actually a bug.",
