    "Description": "As mentioned in this posting on EJ: \nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f75/t37825-rawr_mage/p57/#post1831871\nDemonology Warlocks's Dark Intent is not a relevant buff. This buff acts similar to Focus magic in that:\n \n\"You link yourself with the targeted friendly target, increasing both of your haste by 3%. \n \nWhen you or the linked target gains a critical periodic damage or healing effect, the other gains an increased 3% increased periodic damage and healing lasting for 7 sec. Stacks up to 3 times. Dark Intent lasts for 30 min.\"\n \nGranted this spell can only be cast while in Metamorphosis state but still.\n \nhttp://www.wowhead.com/spell=80398",
