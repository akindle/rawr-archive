    "Description": "Currently with other models you can view a representation of your current combat table, ie your misses / dodges / hits / glancing blows etc. Would this be possible to implement with the Cat model? It would make viewing the value of agility/crit versus hit/expertise much easier than the relative stat values which doesn't explain WHY it's the case that these values are higher. Also, separate combat tables for white and yellow attacks",
