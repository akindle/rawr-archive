    "Description": "Still bugged with negative values....even on Ulduar gear being ranked below vendor blues...Theres a serious issue with the way haste is modeled in RAWR for elemental shamans, and clicks round up/down makes no difference.  More haste is always better at certain plateaus, namely the 5th and 6th lightning bolts.  The module should never return neg values.",

If no-one comes forward to update the Elemental model it WILL NOT CHANGE. The ball is in the users court someone who knows Elemental Shaman theorycrafting needs to volunteer. Once they do we can give them lots of help and support to understand how to program Rawr, but we need someone willing to fix things, otherwise the model will be stuck in its current state.",
