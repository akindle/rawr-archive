    "Description": "Working with a friend, she said that Rawr was recommending some weird things, like Str/Crit in sockets that were not matching socket bonuses.  When I tried to take a look, a number of weird things happened:  If I equipped another gemming in the boots, even one that showed a lower DPS than the currently equipped Str/Crit in both sockets, the same gemming appeared to still be equipped, but the numbers in the entire list would still change.  When running an Optimize, it once showed only one item in the left (old) column, the helm, and nothing in the right, not even a new DPS score.\n \nI wish I could be more helpful, but it's just all-around weird.  Play with it a little while, and see if you can reproduce some of what I mentioned.\n \nThis is under Rawr3.",
