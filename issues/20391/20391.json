    "Description": "I don't have much information on this. But it appears relatively consistent: If I open a rawr character and have it on changing options and then unfocus the window and do something else on the computer for some time, if I return later and click on an option the software appears hang and on 100% CPU time (on a single core of the processor). It's peculiar that the graphics of the program are not affected and they are refreshed, it's the reset responsiveness that does not follow. Perhaps the software in whole is not hang but only an interface or interaction section. I've no experience in rawr specifically to understand it more by intuition.",
