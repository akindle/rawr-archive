    "Description": "Every time I upgrade Rawr versions, I keep having to go back and manually update all of the PvP gear (Furious, Relentless, Deadly, etc) through the Armory and Wowhead in order for the default PvP Item filter to pick them up and filter them out.  With the last couple of versions of Rawr, it cannot filter out Furious and Relentless gear.  The source tag on those items after I do an Armory/WowHead refresh says \"Purchasable PvP Item\", so it's at least recognizing the items somewhat appropriately, however, unchecking the PvP Item filter is not delisting these items.  I've tried manually adding an item filter, but I can't seem to get it right.  Can this be looked into?  Alternatively, is it possible to make an Item Filter based on stat and not source?  Would love to just remove any item with Resilience on it in one fell click.",
