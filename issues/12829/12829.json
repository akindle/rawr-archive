    "Description": "I'Ve noticed that with the last beta (b4) the gemming template editor doesn't update its lists, so that after adding a missing gem to the item list, it still doesn't show up in the template editor. Saving and reloading a character often helps, but some gems never show up, even if they are in the item list.",
