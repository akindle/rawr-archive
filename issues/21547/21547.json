    "Description": "Every time I close Rawr on my Mac Book Pro runnin OSX Lion 10.7.1 it takes a while before the window actually closes and during that time (can take up to 2 minutes) a process called mtmd is causing 100% cpu load. I believe the mtmd process had something today with timemachine/versioning but it's only causing this load when closing Rawr, even when Rawr only has been opened for a couple of seconds. Maybe it's an Silverlight issue, I don't have any other silverlight apps to test this. Maybe it's a know issue you can solve by adding some option in Silverlight, dunno. \nÂ \nIt's not the end of the world but I just wanted to share this so maybe you could fix it.",
