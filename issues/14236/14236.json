    "Description": "The on-use effect for the Vengeance of the Forsaken trinket does not appear to be importing properly from Armory. In addition, the program does not appear to be capturing the source (Faction Champions 10-man), or the distinction between the ilvl232 and ilvl245 versions (from 10-man and 10-man heroic, respectively).",

I was able to click the \"Refresh Item Data from Armory\" link and it now shows the effect and is coded in the Special Effects section.  When I choose the \"Refresh Item Data from Wowhead\" it goes back to having no effect other than the 85 expertise that it carries.",
