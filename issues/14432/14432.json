    "Description": "Using Rawr v2.2.22's Warlock model I downloaded my armory and made available to the optimizer some other gear I had in my bank and set the optimizer calculation to Miss Chance with no additonal requirements; I also set thoroughness to max and selected the additional properties Food, Flasks/Elixirs and Talents to optimize as well. The optimizer ran to completion but just as it hit 100% the following error message popped up:\n \nMicrosort .NET Framework\n \nUnhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.\n \nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n \nDetails:\n \nSee the end of this message for details on invoking \njust-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.\n************** Exception Text **************\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at Rawr.Optimizer.ItemInstanceOptimizer.PrivateOptimizeCharacter(Character character, String calculationToOptimize, OptimizationRequirement[] requirements, Int32 thoroughness, Boolean injectCharacter, Boolean& injected, Exception& error)\n \n// MOVED RIDICULOUS WOT TO A FILE, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT IN ISSUE POSTS\n \nI attempted to run the optimizer three times and all three times I got the same error message and clicking on Continue had no results. I am running 64-bit Vista and I see many references in the above details to Win32 so I thought I'd mention that.",
