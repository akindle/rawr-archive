    "Description": "For the mage module, I can't seem to enable mixology for Cataclysm flasks (Lesser Flask of Resistance, Flask of Steelskin, Flask of the Draconic Mind) and double potting for any potion (Potion of Speed, Potion of Wild Magic, Deathblood Venom, Volcanic Potion) within the \"Buffs\" tab, at the same time.\n \nIf I enable mixology for any of the cataclysm flasks and then enable double potion trick for any potion, the mixology option becomes unchecked and I am unable to click on this mixology checkbox unless I disable the double potion trick option.\n \nThis bug does not seem to effect any flasks besides the Cataclysm flasks.\n \nThis does not seem to be a browser issue as I have tried this out on internet explorer, firefox, and chrome, which have all provided me with the same results.\n \nVersion of Rawr: 4.0.20.0b - Mage Module",
