    "Description": "When loading my hunter from the armoury (Finbarr on Ravenholdt-EU), crit percentage shows up as over 750%. This appears to be caused by the survival talent 'master tactician', which is adding about 143% crit per point. Removing all points from the talent works around this for now.",
