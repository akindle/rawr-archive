    "Description": "I realise Rawr is mainly intended for PvE use but while using it to work out my reforging on my PvP set I noticed that my resilience was incorrect when I checked it in Bear, 4538 instead of the 4138 it is in game. After a bit of checking it seems that when 2 pieces of the PvP set are equipped my resilience goes up by an extra 800 instead of 400.",
