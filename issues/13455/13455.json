    "Description": "(785+SP) * (1 + 0.06 + 0.3 + 0.1) * 1.15 * 0.8 is the correct formula to calculate the dmamage from this spell.  posted here http://elitistjerks.com/f80/t38033-mage_equivalent_destruction_warlock/p39/#post1270092   by  Zakalwe.  This is for the standard full destro spec.  Rawr #s show over 27k for conflag with my current gear and even with both trinkets proced I wouldn't break 16k in full 25 man buffs.  \nÂ \nRoF damage also seems out of line.  Most of the other numbers seem fine though",
