    "Description": "In a previous version of Rawr, I had used the optimizer and it gave me an optimal set of gear with an overall score of 9082.31. Today, I loaded it again and ran the optimizer on v2.2.24 with thoroughness to the max and overall rating as the calculation to optimize and it returned sets with a lower overall score and different ones each time I ran it.\nÂ \nMy character profile in the optimal set is included as an attachment",

The results aren't very trustworthy without running multiple trials and keeping track of the maximum score that you recieved\r\n\r\nAlso, with thoroughness up to the max it shouldn't really matter how long it takes as long as it finds the best score",

    {
      "Message": "Err, there's a bit of misunderstand going on here. Yes, the Optimizer doesn't try every possible configuration, as that would indeed take eons, literally. However, it does try many many different sets of gear, watches for patterns, and intelligently tries more that are similar, in order to try to find the best one. That's where the Thoroughness slider comes in. It'll keep searching for upgrades for longer, the higher the Thoroughness. It'll frequently not find the best solution when using a low Thoroughness, but on max thoroughness it'll find the solution somewhere around 99% of the time. If you're getting 'different ones each time I ran it', then something's wrong, or you're *extremely* unlucky. And if the solution it's finding is lower than the current score, then that implies that you have something currently equipped that you don't have marked available. Since you posted your character, we can investigate all that. Kavan, see anything interesting?",

To combat that you should have increased the thoroughness even more, but obviously you're limited by the slider max setting in ui. Running it several times and taking the best is the only way you can combat this currently (batch tools can help with that somewhat), unless you want to compile the application yourself and changing the maximum possible value for thoroughness.",
