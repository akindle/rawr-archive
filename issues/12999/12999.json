      "Message": "In regard to the tree module:\r\nI'm pretty sure the Intensity talent was already using the new values inside the module and that was only a talent GUI issue, but will check.\r\n\r\nWe missed the Nature's Bounty change in both the model and GUI, now updated in patch 33188.\r\n\r\nThe effects of Revitalize isn't being modelled at all, the talent GUI display now updated in patch 33188 though. \r\n\r\nThe Glyph of Nourish isn't being modelled yet. Will look at adding that at some time over the weekend, shouldn't be too difficult.\r\n\r\nWild Growth's values are displayed, but its healing isn't being included in the model (only mana and cast time is consumed), thus the Glyph of Wild Growth won't affect modelled healing scores. Will nevertheless look at adding that.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
