    "Description": "I've tried the current development build of Rawr on my holy paladin and the Relative Stat Values comparison chart has changed completly and in a kind of weird way:\nIntellect from 3,05 + 0,31 = 3,36 to 0,92 + 0,31 = 1,23\nMP5 from 3,21 to 0,41\nSpell Power from 1,42 + 0,74 = 2,16 to 1,5 + 0,74 = 2,23\nHaste Rating from 0,62 + 1,31 = 1,93 to 2,39 + 1,31 = 3,7\nCrit Rating from 1,38 + 0,4 = 1,79 to 0,83 + 0,4 = 1,23\nÂ \nLooks like if I had almost endless mana spamming HL (which is not the case). Recommends me changing 264 gear to T9.232 :-)",

I'll have to fix that.\r\n\r\nAs for why the stats all changed around, that does seem rather odd, and I'll look into at least getting an explanation as to why it's done that.",
