    "Description": "When I was looking through possible upgrade paths, I noticed that by changing any blue gem to a purified dreadstone would make that piece of gear be near the top of the list for my moonkin.  I'm pretty sure my 219 necklace will not beat out 3/4 of 25 man ICC necks by giving myself 10 more spirit.  It was behaving like that for most of my gear, as long as it was a blue slot.",
