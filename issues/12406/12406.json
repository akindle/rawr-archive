    "Description": "The CalculationsEnhance.cs starting at line 213 has all the calculations for Enhancement Shaman however its still using lvl 70 combat ratings.\n \nI can post the code changes needed here however I am not at all sure who would maintain them and update the source code or if its preferable to post issue in the discussions first or what the protocol is.\n \neg:\n            float modPercentDecrease = stats.ArmorPenetrationRating / 740.740740741f;\nbecomes\n            float modPercentDecrease = stats.ArmorPenetrationRating / 1539.529991f;\n \nfloat chanceCrit = Math.Min(0.75f, (stats.CritMeleeRating + stats.CritRating) / 2208f + stats.Agility / 4000f + .01f * TS);\n \nbecomes\n \nfloat chanceCrit = Math.Min(0.75f, (stats.CritMeleeRating + stats.CritRating) / 4591f + stats.Agility / 4000f + .01f * TS);\n \nand so on. The major problem is that because all the combat ratings are wrong the results are meaningless, and the model is fatally flawed. As such it should be treated as a non working model until the changes have been applied.\n \nCan someone point me in the correct direction so I can assist in fixing this please.",
