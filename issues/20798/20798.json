    "Description": "I'm not sure what is going on, but the coding looks correct when I looked at it. But for some reason, The 4-piece T11 is not getting registered when selecting the fourth piece. I'm providing an example I made up out of the blue and if you select say the T11 helm I have equipped with another helm, the Attack Power does not move. There should be about a 3% drop in Attack Power. I'm not sure if the BonusAttackPower variable is not getting registered or not.\nÂ \nI'm working with the latest source code build.",
