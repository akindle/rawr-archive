    "Description": "Hey all. Thx for the cool app..... just need some clarification on something...\n \nI understand that with the 3.2.2 patch the block value of the Libram of Sacred Shield was increased.\n \nThe new libram tooltip states that it increases block value by 450 each time that Holy Shield is cast.\n \nI noticed that in 2.2.19 i had to modify the value as it was still the old one, and that made me wonder why is it that the item is defined in the rawr db as increasing ShoR block value and not just plain BV?\n \nAnd is it correct to choose the HolyShield option as the trigger? My goal is to check if LoSS finally outweighs Libram of Obstruction.",
