    "Description": "I'm finding that the \"Melee Avoid %\" optimizer setting is trying to cap out my Expertise so that my attacks aren't Parried or Dodged.  While I believe it's an obtainable goal for both, it does rather limit my gear options to strive for both.\nÂ \nI see in the DK models that you can set the optimizer to just reaching the Dodge cap, or just setting a certain Expertise skill level to achieve.  I don't want to turn this into a \"you don't need Expertise\" thread.  All I want to know is if this is this something that can be done with the Ret model?",

      "Message": "Expertise is working normally.  Dodge and parry are indeed separate and accounting for mob level.  Parry is guided entirely by the '% time in front' setting.\r\n\r\nIt's weird... I'm not sure atm why Ermad implemented it like this, but it would appear that the \"melee avoid%\" optimizable stat is currently implemented as a \"chance for melee hit to land%\" and it's used inside the ret module in several places as precisely that. (even though the name would indicate otherwise).\r\nSo you would currently want to optimise using \"melee avoid%\" >= 100% (up to 2.3.18 and on until the ret release notes say otherwise).\r\n\r\nThis stat accounts for dodge, parry and misses. So it'll optimise both hit and  expertise.  There's currently no way to force meeting the expertise cap, but not caring about the hit cap.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about how to best fix this atm.  Change the name, or flip the stat around, or separate miss and dodge/parry as optimisable stats.\r\n\r\n",
