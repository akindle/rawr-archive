      "Message": "Student of the Mind works fine for me with Molten Armor and Glyph of Molten Armor. Most likely, you have \"Automatic Armor\" turned on (this really should be turned off by default, it causes so many problems for people) and it's selecting Mage Armor on you, which would negate any affect that Student of the Mind would have on your crit rating.",

      "Message": "If Automatic Armor is not selecting Molten Armor that's because Mage Armor is actually better given the parameters you gave it. Better than to disguise the problem and forcing it to use Molten Armor find out what settings you have set wrong that would mage Mage Armor better. Most likely you're missing critical mana regen buffs.",

      "Message": "The auto-armor option should be moved to the buffs tab, or when it's selected, disable the armor buff options on the buff tab and show which is selected.  When selecting a specific buff, you'd expect the stats to change accordingly.  I was just curious to see how well Student of the Mind scaled with certain buffs and glyphed Molten Armor without doing the math.. but perhaps I'm beating a dead horse here, it sounds like this is a common misunderstanding.",
