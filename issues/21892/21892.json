    "Description": "Discussion of this staff on Wowhead and EJ's appears to indicate that Rawr is greatly underestimating the proc on this staff.\n \nCurrently in Rawr it is a 19.8k heal with a 15% chance on heal cast and a 45sec CD.\n \nI'm not sure on the proc chance but the CD is reported to be 15sec.  In addition, the heal is about 7.5k (15k crit) on all targets in a cone in front (with no diminishing returns other than perhaps a cap at overall 90k healed).     Overall it is doing 5-15% of the casters overall healing on fights depending on how many targets it is hitting.  \n \nEven just adjusting the internal CD of the item makes it by far BiS for my druid.",
