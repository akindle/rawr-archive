If you notice, the health you get from stam on your character sheet isn't what you would expect from the amount of stam you actually have. When naked, I have 170 stam talented, and I get 1520 health from it. So the first 18 are considered \"base\" for the calculation of the tauren bonus.\"\r\n\r\nSince the value it was updated to is 8338 (7941 * 1.05), that would seem to be incorrect and it should be 8527 (8121 * 1.05)\r\n\r\nI don't have a high-level Tauren, so I cannot confirm.",
