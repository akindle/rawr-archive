    "Description": "Could be of interest to add an Event tab similar to the One in the Warlock module.\nHere events in the rotation could be listed with the timings. At the top a summary of the number of shots fired could be listed. (similar to what is done if the debug option is set to true in code).\nÂ \nHowever, this would need to be called only once, and not as in \"debug mode\"... every time an item's/talent's/buff's dps is calculated",
