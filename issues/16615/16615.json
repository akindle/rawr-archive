    "Description": "Hey i just played my Frost DK to 80 and played around to see what upgrades i can get from heroics and triumph emblems. Then i just noticed something:\nI have 3 Trinkets: twice a switf hand of justice (64haste) and one is a caster trinket with another 74 haste (and 1k shadowdamage on casts (so proccs sometimes from howl/icy touch)\n \nnow if i equip twice hand of justice, i get ~30 dps on each\nif i equip the caster trinket this and many other haste equip (like neck) show negative values (-20 on the pendalum and -25 on the swift hand of justice for example)\nso rwar even suggest the stamina trinket (azjolnerub 2nd boss) provides \"more\" dps... this cant be.\n \nsame goes if i add a 10 haste stone to a socket (in golves)... i virtually lose damage against an unsocket one  (even i have 14 strength and 10 haste more!)",

      "Message": "i narrowed the problem down to the passive haste of icy talons, without that talent (but buff active or not) the haste seem to scale normal, no matter how i itemize. but with the talent haste goes from negative to huge positve amounts...",

      "Message": "maybe that wasnt it, the problem seems more overall, haste gets very jumpy from negative to huge postive amounts even with talent/buff from icy talon on/off in different combinations, depend on the amount of haste i already got.\r\n\r\nits now nearly impossible to determine haste items for frost dk... maybe the main problem is killing machine, as with more swings it maybe calculates a proc less, so the overall damage breaks down? i have no idea :/ i hope this get fixed till patch as i saw we get even more haste (and maybe some more dks consider rolling frost and need rawr ^^)",
