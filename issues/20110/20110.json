      "Message": "Build Upgrade List and Optimize don't use the same scale for thoroughness in the main optimize screen. There used to be an old bug report for this already but it's probably been closed. I think the main motivation for that was to make both correspond to roughly the same time spent on the action, although I don't think that was the right decision.\r\n\r\nFor a workaround you can load that single character in batch tools and use build upgrade list from there, batch tools uses the same thoroughness scale for all actions.",
