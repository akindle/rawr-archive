    "Description": "Rawr has been very slow building upgrade lists for my warlock. This is from v2.3.1: after 10 hours, with thoroughness set to 50%, it was 25% complete. I briefly let v2.3.2 run today, and it is still quite slow.\n \nRelevant info: AMD Athlon II X4 620 (2.60 GHz) processor, 4.00 GB of RAM, running Windows 7.\n \nI've attached the character's XML file. Thanks!",
