    "Description": "PLEASE update the item cache before distributing a new version of Rawr.  I have had to update my item cache every time I've downloaded a new version over the past 3 months.  It's getting very annoying.\nÂ \nEach time I've downloaded a new version I have lots of \"Not found on Armory\" or \"Unknown\" item locations.  For example, I just downloaded 2.3.5 and the Hood of Fiery Aftermath (ilvl 245) is being displayed as \"Not found on armory\".  That item has been available for months and it's not up to date in the item cache.  COME ON.  I'm tired of manually going through my upgrade list and manually updating each item.",
