    "Description": "If I change the Deathbringer's Will ArP to 0 it will not give any DPS out so the proc does not seem to provide any effect. Does the implementation of the Deathbringer's Will proc account for different Classes having different stats being boosted?\nI changed the proc to be on Physical hit instead of Melee hit, description says Attacks... maybe Misses are included as well. But that gave no effect either.",
