    "Description": "Shadow Infusion and Dark Transformation isn't being properly modelled yet, it affects a number of things:\n-Runic Power is under valued (Butchery talent is valued negatively)\n-T12 2 piece bonus (Elementium Deathplate) is valued negatively\n-It seems to affect the value of mastery at some points although I don't understand how.\n \nI tried adding a hacked dps of 1/3*ghoul dps as a value for Dark Transformation. \n \nFrom worldoflogs, it seems 50-60% uptime can be achieved. Sweeping claw on a single target seems to do about double damage from normal claw. Is this then 2x ghoul damage with 50% uptime, so about same as normal ghoul dps?",
