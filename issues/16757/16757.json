    "Description": "On my mage, I have 3 JC gems equipped, and Rawr 2.3.11 keeps telling me to replace all my red gems with the JC +39 SP gems. I found it out it only happens when the top Epic (JC) gemming template (all red + meta) is enabled, disabling it reverts to previous experience.  Enforce Gem Requirements is enabled, which I thought one purpose of it was to ensure that unique-equip gem limits aren't exceeded.\nAlso related, wasn't there previously functionality added so that during optimize JC gems won't be moved to different items?",
