    "Description": "Some charts have the scales set too large.  For example the Bear Trinket chart starts at -4 million and goes to + 29 million.  Since the trinkets generally have a value of around 20,000 I end up seeing a graph where the bars are so thin they cannot be seen, they are just a vertical line.  Same issue both on web based and installed versions.  I saw the patch notes mentioned this \"57796 by Jothay Fri at11:16 PM 0 Rawr.Base: Fix for Charts not starting on 0.0 \" and might guess that the change had this undesired side effect.  Note that not all items do this, helms seem fine for example.",
