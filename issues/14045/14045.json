If I optomise, while having misery and heroic presence ticked, the optomiser suggests 3 x  hit gems taking me well over the actual hitcap in my spec which is 184 with those buffs present.  My sister in law has the same issue. she is well over the hitcap in a fire spec without using any gems, but the optomiser suggests 4 x hit gems to get her hitcapped.",

Also on stats tab it shows hit as 17.23% which is above cap. But for me the character shows 347 hit rating from gear, not 280 as you said. Also the hit cap for fire spec is 341 with heroic presence and misery. 184 is hit cap for arcane spec. Maybe the problem is that you had the wrong spec selected in your character than what you wanted?",
