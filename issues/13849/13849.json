    "Description": "Usually when i load my character from the armory, it is assigned maximum buffs.  I use those to create a profile with those buffs and then un-select most buffs to create a self-buffed profile.\n \nThe self buffed DPS listed was 3222.  I selected a couple of upgrades from the list, namely the T 8.5 helm that i just got and the T 8 legs which had been in my bags.  The DPS figure then changed to 3421 DPS.  In the Comparison bar graph chart for the Helm, it is listed as 561 DPS.\n \n Then i selected Arcane Int as a buff, overall DPS went up to 3482 but the Helm's DPS in the chart goes down to 512.91 DPS as do most of the items in the Bar graph.  \n \nNot sure if this is a bug or not, so i've created it as an issue.",
