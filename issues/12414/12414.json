    "Description": "Also Armor is not showing a threat change with Armored to the Teeth talent.\nÂ \nThese are because the relative stats are calculated by the first overall change the attribute applies. For instance, Armor will change mitigation and survival every point, but it takes many points to get attack power out of it. So the relative stats see the survival and mitigation changes and stop calculating. Same for Strength, every point changes threat, but only every other changes block value.",
