    "Description": "HolyPriest and RestoShaman are set to always compile into the debug folder. Can we have them set to release now that they are functional?\nÂ \nAlso, HolyPriest is targetted to and uses objects from .NET 3.5 rather than 2.0. I'm not sure how many priests are using Rawr and only have .NET 2.0 but certainly this changes the platform requirements listed on the Rawr homepage.",
