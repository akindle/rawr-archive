    "Description": "[1] In the \"Spell Cycles\" popup, the last spell cycle(ABFrB3FrBSc) shows 3081 seconds of time.  The fight duration is set as 360 seconds.  (This weirdness continues happens down whenever this negative cost (mp5) cycle is included).\n[2] If I right click on an equipped item, edit it, duplicate it, add a new gemming and save -- shortly thereafter I get a exception (Cannot access a disposed object.  Object name: 'ItemButton').\n[3] Certain very unlikely items with odd gemming (Amulet of Flowing Life - w/Royal Shadowsong Ameythyst) are sorting to the top of the best items in slot when I click items OR display the comparisons for that slot.\n[4] The TPS numbers are whacked -- I'm looking at 2285.06 DPS but 9620.97 TPS !!!",
