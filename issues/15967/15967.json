    "Description": "Version: 2.3.6\n \nWhen using the optimizer in 2.3.6, Rawr tells me that \"Greater Spirit\" and \"Superior Spellpower\" are missing items. The items which these enchants are on are selected as available and equipped. Exchanging \"Superior Spellpower\" for \"Greater Spellower\" tells me that \"Greater Spellpower\" is a missing item. So, since enchants can't be modified as available or something, I'm guessing they're broken.\n \nThanks in advance!",
