If you are still stuck on this, you must be somehow caching an old version of Rawr and the Silverlight cache. This is common with Google Chrome users and you need to force refresh the page with Shift+F5 after deleting the Silverlight Cache in the Silverlight Settings.",

      "Message": "In case this helps anyone I was able to make an error very similar to this go away by using options-->Edit Items-->Add to add item number 49793, Tower of Mouldering Corpse.  It was Jothay's question asking what the difference between the working and broken armory sets that set me on the track to making the problem go away.  I went though the following grueling 3 hour process:  I tried everything listed here regarding cache.  I checked that all my software versions met requirements.  I checked to make sure I had the latest version of rawr.  I took all my armor off. Logged out.  Tried rawr.  It worked with no error.  Logged in and put on several pieces of armor.  Logged out.  Tried rawr.  Repeated until problem came back.  Removed several pieces until I narrowed it down to one piece of armor that caused the problem.  Discovered that particular piece of armor could not be edited.  In other words it was not in the cache.  I added it.  And then I could load my character.  The exact error I made go away with this method was:\r\n\r\n== Error Message ==\r\n[Arg_IndexOutOfRangeException]\r\nArguments: \r\nDebugging resource strings are unavailable.
