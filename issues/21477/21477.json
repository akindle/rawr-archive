    "Description": "Reforge/enchant/gem-only optimize on frost mages seem to be a bit wonky. No matter what I seem to do, it will always optimize to a DPS decrease. The attached file is myself, US-Stormrage Kuni, on the default fight settings of a fresh download, telling it to optimize at the highest setting. I get similar results when trying to model my guild's last Baleroc kill as close as I can. From what I can see, it seems that the formulation isn't valuing pre-4pT12 mastery as high as it should be, as every result seems to be mastery -> haste.\n \nI'm unsure if the optimizer is just required to change something, because there's no other reason it should give a lower DPS result than what it started with.\n \nAs a side note, the default frost build is out of date. It should be 2 in netherwind presence insetad of 2 in arcane concentration.",
