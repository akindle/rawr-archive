    "Description": "I'm seeing some strange issues with item values on my warlock lately. I'm not sure if its limited to just the warlock module, but I've attached a character profile to show what i'm refering to as well. I beleive its only affecting items with haste on them, if that helps narrow it down. \n \nAs you can see in the profile, the cloak currently has no enchant for the cloak being used. The off hand item Surplus limb is then given a value of 10.81 which is incredibly low for this item. Next if you go to change the cloak enchant to say \"Greater Speed\" you'll notice it provides no dps insrease at all for adding 23 haste. I understand diminishing returns but zero bonus at all makes no sense. And now for the really od piece, when the cloak enchant of greater speed is on (that did not provide any dps increase itself), the surplus limb is now valued at 113.44. so somehow adding a cloak enchant that gives 0 dps increase, made an item jump up 102.63. There definately appears to be an issue with how items are being valued compared to others. \n \nAlso as you can see, without a cloak enchant, items like the Twilight Tome, Seal of Valgarde, and a couple others have literally a negative value. I understand those items being at the bottom of the list since they've low blue's, but how can any item with spell power and no negative bonuses ever have a item value of negative to say it add's no dps at all. Even an item with 1 sp, adds some kind of dps boost. Very small bonus but it exists. Another area i've seen strange item values is neck pieces in regards to evokers charm being undervalued greatly at times, and many items again with negative values.",

I grind a lot of rep for mounts in old content so I have a template where the level of mobs Im fighting is 80.  After setting the level, I noticed something strange in the list of neck pieces..\r\n\r\nIt rates a PvP item...the  Deadly Gladiator's Pendant of Dominance (ilevel 213 -- 38 crit, resil 37, 66 spell power)  at 118.81\r\nand the Evoker's Charm (purchased with Emblems of Conquest (Level 226 -- Spirit 41 Haste 42 Spell Power 74) at -23.70  (not a typo its a negative value)\r\n\r\nSecondly, \r\nit rates a PvP item, the Deadly Gladiator's Cloak of Subjugation (ilevel 213 -- 38 haste, resil 37, 66 spell power)  at 212.61\r\nover the Deathchill Cloak (iLevel 200 -- 43 crit, 53 haste, spell power 59) at 97.15\r\n\r\nif these items had been +hit heavy, I could kind of understand the shift when I sit the filter against level 80 content. But the two examples Ive given clearly show that some sort of error is taking place when its determining dps values for these items.  For what its worth 2.2.16 did not have these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
