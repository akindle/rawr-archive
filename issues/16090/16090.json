    "Description": "Numerous items have the exact same name but several different ilvl versions and it's only getting worse as they add more gear but try to keep the number of names and item models down.\n \nWe can already mouse over an item and get info about ilvl and where it's from.\n \nTo speed this operation up and take away the need to mouseover, just include the ilvl after the name of the item in most lists, like the Upgrade and the right-hand pane in the main window.",

Or even just an H for heroic.\r\n\r\n(H) Thassarian's Gauntlets of T\r\nis better than\r\nThassarian's Gauntlets of Triumph (258)\r\nwhich is much better than\r\nThassarian's Gauntlets of Triumph *mouseover tooltip* item level 258\r\n\r\nHonestly I'd be much happier if I only had to mouseover to see the full item name for something with a long title, rather than every time I try to find a piece of Heroic gear. It's particuarly annoying while using the item set comparison tool, where you have to go and pick out every item by name.",
