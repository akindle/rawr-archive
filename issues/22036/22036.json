    "Description": "I got the \"new rawr version\" email, and reloaded the EJ rawr web page; the footer still says 4.3.4.0, not 4.3.5.0.  I tried restarting my browser (google chrome) and flushing the cache, but it still says 4.3.4.\n \nIs it possible the new version hasn't hit EJ yet, even though the announcement went out?\n \nThe WPF downloadable version has the newer (4.3.5.0) version number, so its not just that someone didn't bump the in-app version number.",
