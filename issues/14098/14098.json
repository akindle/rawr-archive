    "Description": "Despite r36558, I am getting an odd value for my weapon(s), and when the weapon is changed at all, NaN error relating to weapons as both Arms and Fury.  On the dropdown menu, all weapons are wither oddly valued, or not valued at all (depending on if it's mainhand or offhand).  Additionally, the comparisons pane shows odd values for all weapons (not a value, but a straight red bar across the entire width for all weapons).\nÂ \nAttaching two character files that this happens with.",
