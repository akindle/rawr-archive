      "Message": "To clarify, I think it's a valid approach to consider.  There are situations where I'd rather have 30dodge than 40agi/40sta.  Min/Maxing your avoidance, these give ~0.2% more avoidance than the Agi food (which admittedly is more EH and more threat, it's LESS avoidance).  Basically, it's exactly what is all the rage right now in the War/Pal hardmode tanking community.  If we don't want to support this through \"cluttering up the food choices\", there should be some other way to model it (options panel?).  Personally, what with all the clutter we already have in the buffs/potions/food panels, what's one more food gonna hurt?",

Based on that, I'd expect that there'd be no use for this food for a ProtPaladin, since their Agi->dodge conversion must be higher than dodge rating->dodge. However, that seems suspect to me, and I'm curious of there's a bug there (like, not applying DR to dodge from Agi?).",

Sta means nothing, Armor means nothing, if you can't get to 101.8% blocked damage (or whatever the actual percentage is, forget off-hand).\r\n\r\nHowever, after double-checking the numbers, 40agi = 33.6dodge rating.  So yeah, agi food is the better route.  It's gonna be more raw avoidance, as BrWarner said.",

Triple-checking the numbers from Whitetooth's Combat Ratings post, using 3.2 numbers, it turns out that 30 Dodge is worth .6630% Dodge, and 40 Agi is worth .5192% Dodge (simply confirming your earlier numbers).  While I personally would still use the Agi food, even if I were to tank all 4 adds (and I do understand the particulars of that role), the Dodge food does technically provide more raw avoidance for Warriors, and should therefore be included within Rawr.",
