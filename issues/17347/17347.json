    "Description": "I found 4 items in the cache that have the wrong factions associated with them.  I believe all 4 had the wrong faction in Wowhead at some point but they have since been fixed (see work item #15387 for reference).  All 4 have since been fixed on Wowhead but there is code in Item.cs which prevents these items from being fixed in the cache.  You can work around the code by doing a refresh on each of these items from the armory then another refresh from Wowhead but it would be better if the items were updated in the cache that we all download with each version.  I'll list the items below:\n \n50211 - Arcane Loops of Anger - Alliance\n50213 - Mord'rethar Robes - Horde\n50227 - Surgeon's Needle - Alliance\n50228 - Barbed Ymirheim Choker - Alliance\n \nAll 4 items should be marked as faction neutral.",
