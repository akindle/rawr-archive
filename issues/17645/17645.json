    "Description": "I think there is something wrong with the way this model calculates hit. I have the exact same setup in WoW as in my file, yet in Rawr it tells me I have 17.84% spellhit, but in WoW I would have 17.38% with full raid buffs /w IFF (246 hit rating). I have enclosed the file I am using.",
