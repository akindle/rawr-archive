    "Description": "Would it be possible to get some better support for some of the more unique melee trinkets that are out there?  Some of the specific specific trinkets I'm thinking about are Fury of the Five Flights, which should probably come out to a straight up 320 AP, and Incisor Fragment, which has an Armor Pen click use which averages about to 48.5 Ar Pen rating.  As well, support for the differing version of Darkmoon Card: Greatness would be helpful.",
