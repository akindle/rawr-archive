    "Description": "Hi, I am a druid. I was supposed to wear leather. So I filtered the cloth out of \"item listed\".\nBut by some chance, I got a few cloth items. So I turned on cloth for temporary to list them out and mark as options. Then turned it off.\nThen I got item (the cloth) unavailable when optimizing. Even when I was wearing them.",
