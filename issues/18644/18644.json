    "Description": "Shadow priest hit values are being miscalculated in relationship to the cap.\n \nAs an example from a fresh 80 toon with very little hit gear:\nHit from gear: 1.11% from 29 hit rating\nHit from talents/racial: 7%\nRawr analysis: 115.11% Shadow hit, 396 hit rating above cap\n \nI've checked two different toons and both 2.3.22 as well as the 3 online beta with the same result.  Also, hit doesn't even show up on the Relative Stat Values page, which I suspect is related.",
