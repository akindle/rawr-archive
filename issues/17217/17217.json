    "Description": "In the moonkin version of HasRelevantStats, it first checks to see if the item has an interesting effect and if not then it looks at the items stats.  Several of the stats that HasRelevantStats considers interesting are not used in GetCharacterStats and I believe therefore cannot impact the value of the item.  The result of this is that the selection charts are clogged with items with a 0 rating and we feed all these items through the build upgrade list process (or so I believe).  The \"useless\" stats for moonkin that are considered relevant are: \n  stats.ToString().Equals(\"\")  // i.e. no stats on the item at all\n  stats.Stamina\n  stats.Agility\n  stats.Health",
