    "Description": "I noticed that the glyph of Mangle was not affecting my overall DPS value when it was turned on or off.  Since I am wearing 4pc I will be Mangling at east once every 30 seconds and 3 times early in the fight.\n \nI also noticed that it still has no value when I turned off Mangle being a provided buff.  If a bleed buff is not checked then the cat will be Mangling and there should then be some value to the Mangle glyph.\n \nSecond issue to follow with regard to Mangle buff in general, my be related.",
