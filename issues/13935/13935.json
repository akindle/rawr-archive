Its very simple possible.\r\n\r\nThe wowhead, buffed, speedydragon has api's to get the original English Name and a translated Name for all items. In Rawr addin a switch to change the Language and after Reset the Cache, use the translated Name as Itemname and only for Items without translated Name use the Original Name.\r\n\r\nThe same for Gems and Enchanded (Same way).\r\n\r\nAnother Methode are, Change the Item cache und add a new Field for translated Name. and use it to display it as name in the Window. And in the next Step addind Multilanguage Support in the Tool.\r\n\r\nThe Curseforge has a nice Implemention about Multilanguage support. In the Webfrontend you can setup a Multilanguagefile and fill it out with all Translation. After this Step, you can Add Any Languages and other Users can help you in the translation. After Release Submit, Curseforget write all Languages in sourcefiles. This can be now Downloaded. This way can help you in Deployment.",
