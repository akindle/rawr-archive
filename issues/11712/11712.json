    "Description": "Hi.\n \nNot sure if those are Rawr errors or website errors. Here we go:\n - Updating \"Flowing Cloak of Command\"  (id: 37084 ) from Wowhead results in  868 armor points retrieved, while the cloak only have 504 points of armor listed there.  Updating from armory works fine.\n - Updating \"The Severed Noose of Westwind\" (id: 44033 ) (and many others) from Armory results in 0 AP retrieved, while the actual item have 68 APs. Updating from Wowhead works fine. \n \nThis may be errors not in Rawr but in how the data is provided by the sources. But web browsing with Firefox the actual items in the respective pages, there they show the correct values.\n \nHope this can be addresed though, as I got many item mistakes after asking for a Item Cache Refresh, and now I cannot fully trust neither Wowhead nor Armory reloads...\n \nRegards.",

      "Message": "This is actually a few different issues.\r\n\r\nIn the original bug \"The Severed Noose of Westwind\" updates correctly from the Armory, but incorrectly from Wowhead.  The crit rating and attack power are both missing.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Items have no AP on them.  You only get the AP when they are equipped as a set.  However the set is not being recognized when updated from the Armory.\r\n\r\nBloodied Leather Gloves and Weakness Spectralizers likely have the same problem as The Severed Noose of Westwind as they have the same symptoms.\r\n\r\n(I have to leave soon so I can't check the wowhead parsing.  Sorry!)\r\n",
