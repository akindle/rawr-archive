    "Description": "This would be useful as in the 10mans I run, I almost always am required to be on interrupt duty in some form or other.    This greatly increases the value of Hit on my gear and may also affect overall calculations if I am required to interrupt every 10-15 secs.\nÂ \nThe fact that Hit is now important to me even though it isn't a big DPS increase means there is a much larger disparity between the Direct Upgrade pane and the results of a \"Build Upgrade List\" run which makes the gear lists much less useful and Rawr a lot slower to use (due to needing to run Build Upgrade Lists all the time).",
