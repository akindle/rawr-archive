      "Message": "Master Poisoner should not be auto selected if you have the talent as selecting it will mean that someone else in your raid is keeping the 3% Crit debuff up, which can be useful if you for some reason use dual Instant Poison.\r\nAs I'm planning to in the future let the optimizer select the poisons (with an override of course) it might turn out for it to better to not keep Master Poisoner active if someone else in your raid already does it.",
