    "Description": "The optimizer must think that gems grow on trees.  It tells me to remove replace an orange gem with a red gem and then place the exact same orange gem in an empty slot.\n \nAt the moment I would be happy if the optimizer left my current gemmings alone and simply made recommendations for my empty slots.  Manually (ugh) placing blue dots in front of each gemmed item helps a little, but the optimizer persists in regemming my rep ring, my shoulders, and my belt.\n \nYes, I unchecked the box that says override regemming.",

      "Message": "I have had cases when optimizing that I only need 1/2 of my gemming to get some stat up to a cap, in which case it will randomly choose which sockets to use each time I optimize.  This does become a little bit of a pain, especially when it randomly chooses between using mixed-color gems and solid-color gems each time, too.  However, the way I use it, it's not enough of a pain to request a new feature myself.",
