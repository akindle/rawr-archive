    "Description": "Steps:\nTools > Edit Items\n \nAny item (Ahn'Kahar Blood Hunter's Headpiece as an example), change the ID to something invalid, like 999999.\n \nDO NOT PRESS ENTER.\n \nSelect another item (Ancient Iron Heaume, the one right below our example), and notice the hang.\n \nCPU usage stays stable (at 0, while memory usage slowly creeps up).\n \nThis hang has been noticed regardless of which item's ID is changed.\n \nActually pressing enter instead of simply changing focus will change the ID into 10000 as well as not hanging, so it's the current workaround for this behavior.",

      "Message": "There is no hang actually when I tested. Doing exactly what you said, when clicking on Ancient Iron Heaume it doesn't actually select the item, but it doesn't hang either. What happens is the ID edit field has a maximum value of 100000. Since you entered a value outside of allowed range it didn't accept the value. I guess we can just increase the max allowed value to make more room for \"invalid\" ids if there is need for it.",
