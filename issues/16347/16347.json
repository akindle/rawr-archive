    "Description": "This is an issue with the warrior model. Not sure why this is happening, but when i go from 2 to 3 points into Intensify Rage in the fury tree my dps actually goes down which i can't understand. Irregardless of what setting i have a decrease in those cool down timers should be an increase no matter what.\n \nWell I switched my spec around and optimized and it isn't doing the error anymore. If i find out how to reproduce it i'll add to this.",
