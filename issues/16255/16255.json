    "Description": "Per EJ testing by Aldriana and Landsoul, it seems there was a fix to the game or Recount was incorrectly parsing certain hits (partial blocks seems to be the main culprit at the moment). White hits obey the 4.8% crit reduction seen by yellow attacks, and not a conversion. IE you gear for 70.8% crit to get to the white crit cap. (70.8% crit+24%Glance-4.8% crit = 100%)",
