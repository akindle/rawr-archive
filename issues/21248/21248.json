    "Description": "Tonight I spoke to another arcane mage, and he told me he prioritizes haste over hit and mastery, and that he doesn't use Rawr. At first, I thought I was speaking with a madman, but I'm now convinced that if there are any sane people on my server, he's all of them, and that it's time to carry the flag of sanity home to the Warsong Lumber Mill of Rawr development.\n \nHe pointed out that in a lot of situations, such as when the Spark of Rhyolith spawns, maximizing burst damage on a priority target turns out to be more important than maximizing total damage over the entire fight. And in the real world, decent raiders time our cooldowns based on the tactical demands of boss mechanics, not based on the output of sequence reconstruction. This is true of healing and mitigation too -- sustained healing and mitigation are important, but you have to save cooldowns for when they're needed most, or you'll wipe the raid.\n \nWhy not add a Burst score for damage dealers and healers, based on the amount we can deal in, say, 15 seconds, if we save our cooldowns for some specific point in time? That'll bring the value being optimized a bit closer to what actually matters.",
