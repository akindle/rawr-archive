    "Description": "The prismatic gem Enchanted Tear is treating the meta requirement in one Enchanted Tear Gem. I'm attaching my kitty gear. In it I have the Relentless Earthsiege Diamond. This requires 1 red gem, 1 blue gem, and 1 yellow gem. I recently read to use the Enchanted Tear for any blue sockets. So I turned on Enchanted Tear in the enchanted > Tier options. After running the optimizer it told me to change out the blue and yellow gems in my chest to 1 agility and put the Enchanted Tear into my Sinners Binding. That was the ONLY Tear it told me to put the gem in.",
