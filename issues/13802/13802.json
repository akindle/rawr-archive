      "Message": "It does have a negative effect, in a way: you mangle less. Of course, in reality you could just mangle every 12sec anyway, so it really shouldn't be negative, but Rawr doesn't try to mangle more than is necessary, at the moment. It's rare, but there are circumstances where it's better to mangle more than necessary.",
