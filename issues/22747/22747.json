    "Description": "I am new to Rawr, and so may well be doing something stupid - but I watched the video and under \"File\" I selected \"Load from Battle.net\" - I changed the server to \"EU\", realm to \"Shattered Halls\" and one of my character names, and this is what I am getting:\n \nThe remote server returned an error: (503) Server Unavailable.\n \n   at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.EndGetResponse(IAsyncResult asyncResult)\n   at System.Net.WebClient.GetWebResponse(WebRequest request, IAsyncResult result)\n   at System.Net.WebClient.DownloadBitsResponseCallback(IAsyncResult result)\n \nYou can also check the Troubleshooting Guide for more steps on getting Rawr to run smoothly. http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Troubleshooting\n \nIf you still have this problem after performing the suggested fix, please copy and paste this into a new ticket in the Issue Tracker. Thanks!",
