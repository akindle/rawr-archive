      "Message": "Also, please consider searching issues before posting.   If you choose specific fight settings, yes, Trauma can indeed be BiS per those exact fight settings.  These are heavy raid non-stop-chain-heal situations, which don't actually present themselves these days.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing, stop using the term BiS.  There is no BiS when it comes to Rawr.  Top of the list is simply there because the settings you have put in count that as the best item at this time.  This confuses people when you use the term BiS, as BiS has historically meant best in that slot above all other items when you have that specific BiS gear set.\r\n\r\nTo get more realistic show of weapons, change your sustained time to about 3/4 of the way, set the fight length to 7-9 minutes, change your Burst style to RT/CH, and your Sustained to RT/HW.  The model is undergoing major changes to fix the confusion on setting up the variables.  \r\n\r\nSo you understand, no, this is not a bug.  You just happen to have the perfect-storm of variables setup that the healing proc beats all other bonus stats from the items better stat-wise than Trauma.  Changing even a few variables even slightly will make it vanish.",
