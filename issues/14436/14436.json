Any ideas?",

      "Message": "Ah, I see.  :)  I'd say it's too much effort to just add this one item with a special effect to your database, given that it being green it's very transitory.  It would be nice though to be able to add generic effects to an item that are not checked against the model, like in the above case a holy damage trinket used by a hunter.  That way any item could be modeled.  I'm not sure if there are epic items that fall into this category at the moment (probably not) but who knows what Blizz comes up with.",
