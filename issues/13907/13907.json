If it needs to go back then I can make the change.",

      "Message": "Sorry, I am not sure about your change, but your change (36160) is about block value and not block chance resp. block rating.\r\n\r\nBlock value is increased by 30 % (* 1,3) by the (nearly obligatory) talent \"Redoubt\".\r\n\r\nBlock chance is increased by 30 % (+ 0,3) when using \"Holy shield\" that has 100 % uptime in a boss fight with a good paladin tank. You did no change to this in 36160, so I guess (but have not verified) that this happened in commit 36157, because other classes do not have this 0,3 added.",

      "Message": "Now, I finally analyzed the problem. The error persists since 36151, where ProtPaladin\\Lookup.cs\\AvoidanceChance began to use StatConversion.GetDRAvoidanceChance instead of calculation for himself.\r\n\r\nThe error in GetDRAvoidanceChance is that the values are saved as percantage values (so 30 % = 30 and not 0.3), but this is not done consequently for block rating. You can fix the error by changing this line:\r\n\r\nIn Rawr.Base\\StatConversion.cs in function GetDRAvoidanceChance in the case block \"HitResult.Block\" add \"* 100f\" after stats.Block:\r\n\r\n                    baseAvoid = 5.0f + stats.Block * 100f;\r\n\r\nstats.Block is 0.35 for my protection paladin (0.3 coming from Holy Shield). I guess that the 5.0f has to be deleted, too, or stats.Block has to be reduced by 5 % somewhere else. This is up to you as you are deeper in the source code than me.",
