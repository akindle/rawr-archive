As it happens, it&#39;s finding the combination that puts the Expertise enchants where they are, seeing that they satisfy the requirement then looking everywhere else for DPS.",

    "Description": "I ran an optimize with thoroughness maxed and it found the attached gear combination. However there is an obvious upgrade: change crusher on gloves for expertise and expertise on bracers for greater assault, same expertise rating and more AP (these 4 enchants are marked available). It's only 6AP more so maybe even with max thoroughness the optimizer can miss it, but since it's only an enchant swap...\nLet me know if this is an acceptable error margin with maxed settings :)",
