      "Message": "Getting the same kind of error for characters on EU - emeral dream (characters emerlijn, eaglehunter, blackwidow) server: Get Item No Item returned from armory for 41248. Though perhaps it was an issue with new version. So downgraded back to 2.3.11 (didnt had had the 2.3.12 installer left on computer) but received same kind of msgs.\r\n\r\nAfter that tried the new web edition but there it didnt work either. 2.3.13 had worked after first upgrade so perhaps its the \"interface\" from rawr to armory which has changed on the blizzard site.",
