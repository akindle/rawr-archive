    "Description": "I have never trusted rawr's trinket calculations. Nevertheless, I continue to try to get them working accurately so that other gear is calculated correctly. To get to the point, looking at item 37220, I can't figure out how to model the damage reduction for prot paladin. I tried making a special effect, but of course that didn't work. Any suggestions on modeling this item?",

There's not really a whole lot of \"justice\" to be had in its name.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I agree that setting up a new variable would be excellent.  It seems to be pretty easy to implement, too: Take the final damage of the hit taken, and reduce it by the value of the proc.  Shazam.",
