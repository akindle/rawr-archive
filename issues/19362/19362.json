    "Description": "Right now, the only option we have for hit is increasing the threat value. For expertise, that and selecting parry haste.\n \nWhat I'm requesting is a checkbox allowing for \"expertise dodge cap\", and also for \"hit cap\", specially the former.\n \nThe main difference is that, when you increase the threat value, it will increase the importance of agility, attack power etc. With these overrides, only hit rating and expertise are affected.",
