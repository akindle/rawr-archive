    "Description": "Rawr is ranking some items higher then others despite clearly being not as good.  An example is Cry of the Val'kyr normal version statting higher then the heroic version.  Another example being Soulcleave Pendant (ilev 251) coming below Pendant of Split Veins (ilev251) when I am already well above the hit cap (too far above it for my liking).  There are many other items like this that are coming above other items for absolutely no reason at all, less stats, worse gem slots, socket bonuses etc.  Any ideas why this is happening?  Try my character if you want proof: Gurthodd, EU, Eonar",
