    "Description": "Currently, it is possible to sort items by:\n- Overall\n- Alphabetical\n- Survival\n- Mitigation\n- Threat\nÂ \nBut \"Overall\" contains Survival, Mitigation AND Threat. \nI agree to this, but often I'd like a new item which only contains Survival and Mitigation, because Threat, even if it's necessary for tanking, is not a \"protection\" stat if you see what I mean.\nTherefore \"Overall\" sorting does not reflect this if Threat is added to Survival and Mitigation, and items are not sorted as I would like so.",

      "Message": "I understand what you are looking for.  I would suggest going to the options tab and setting Threat Weight = 0.  Keeping the sorting by Overall, but with all threat numbers = 0, means that you'll have things ranked as you describe.  I realize that not all of the Tank models have a Threat Weight style option, so I speak for TankDK in this case.",

      "Message": "Thank you very much ! \r\nExactly what I expected :)\r\nBut why had I to put Threat value at (for example) 1.0 instead of 0.0 (aka None)  ?\r\n\r\nIn fact I realize I would like more than that for the \"Sort\" parameter :\r\n- If Survival is selected, then only Survival bars are displayed. I would like to keep this sort, but also adding the Mitigation bars on right side (but not sorted, of course).\r\n- The same thing for Mitigation sort : Sort by Mitigation first, then add Survival on the right side of the bars.\r\n- And for Overall (since I can remove Threat), keep the current sort : Mitigation + Survival.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about ?",
