      "Message": "What Astrylian means is that the language is broken enough to the point that it's difficult to understand the issue you're reporting.  My closest guess is that you're concerned that the ProtWarrior module is not accurately counting the proc effect into the total value of the trinket.  Is that an accurate interpretation?",
