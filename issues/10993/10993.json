    "Description": "The idea over in the Discussions section of having a status bar at the bottom of Rawr perked my ears up more than a bit and I ended up writing myself one. I figured I should share, so I've attached the patch to this post since I didn't see a place to do it in the discussion. Feel free to use or adapt it if you think it's good enough, checking out Rawr is the first time I've used C# (though having some C/C++ and Java experience obviously helped a ton), so I'm still a little clumsy at it.\nÂ \nBy default, the bar shows the overall value and other model-specific scores that show up in the comparison window. Left clicking will store those scores and show the difference in parentheses after you make changes to gear/buffs/options, and color them green or red by whether they increased or decreased (this duplicates a feature I fell in love with in a rogue spreadsheet I use, allowing you to easily see the net effect of multiple changes). Right clicking clears the values and sets it back to only showing the current numbers.",
