We've established that your Guaranteed Reduction is 0.642466.  Here's how to calculate GuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped:\r\n\r\nGuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped = 1 - (BlockChance * (1 - GuaranteedReduction) * (1 - BlockReduction) + (1 - BlockChance) * (1 - GuaranteedReduction))\r\nGuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped = 1 - (0.7043 * (1 - 0.642466) * (1 - 0.4) + (1 - 0.7043) * (1 - 0.642466))\r\nGuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped = 1 - (0.7043 * 0.357534 * 0.6 + 0.2957 * 0.357534)\r\nGuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped = 1 - (0.15108671772 + 0.1057228038)\r\nGuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped = 1 - 0.25680952152\r\nGuaranteedReductionWhenBlockCapped = 0.74319047848\r\n\r\nThe only real concern I have with considering block-capping is that if you're even one rating point shy of being block-capped, your guaranteed reduction is 0.6425, but adding in that single point bumps the number up to 0.7432.  I would have to question the significance of this stat if we were to include block-capping.",

You could say the same about haste thresholds that give extra ticks on dots or heals.  Prior to 4.0 you could have said the same thing about uncrittable. ",
