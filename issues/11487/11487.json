    "Description": "Why would the attached spell rotation prefer AB2Abar over ABAbar when the spell haste gets very high(w/Heroism)?  The AB2Abar rotation at those levels will stack the the AB debuff.  This is especially surprising since AB2Abar is supposedly lower DPS than ABAbar, per RAWR.   Even AB(3) spam dps is not as good as Abar dps, thus any rotations such as AB2Abar, AB3Abar, ABxAbar will always be lower dps than ABAbar, right?  And both AB & Abar can proc Missile Barrage.\nÂ \nDid I miss something or is this a bug?",

      "Message": "ABABarr is higher DPS and DPM than AB2ABar, when under 33% haste (plus a bit for latency).\r\nOver that much haste, AB2ABar continues going up in DPS with haste, though its DPM plummets.\r\nAt enough haste (ie, under bloodlust) AB2ABar provides higher DPS than ABABar. Since there's nothing else for Arc mages to spend their extra mana on in exchange for more DPS, it will use AB2ABar in those situations, to burn mana (though the dps increase is relatively minor).",
