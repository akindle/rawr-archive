      "Message": "So you are saying t hat you want me to switch out say, Reign of the Dead with Elemental Focusing stone, and it will suggest to swap out your Wand/Legs/Boots/Ring which has hit, to some gear that no hit?\r\n\r\nDid I understand that correctly? I tried that here, and that is what happened.\r\n\r\nBut I think I must have understood something wrong, because that is intended function. Take a look at the Tour of Rawr to see how you could use the Optimizer to do magic tricks.",

      "Message": "If I may interject, what you are seeing is correct, because when you are looking at the value of gloves rawr considers *replacing* your current gloves with each in turn and comparing your dps results.  Since you current gloves have hit, the best items to replace it with will also have hit (so that by replacing them you do not go UNDER cap).  What you need is to have Rawr consider more than just one slot at a time, so you're not needlessly limiting yourself to keeping hit in the same slots.  For that the optimizer should help, and probably some other features too like \"evaluate upgrade\", but I'm not an expert on those.",

      "Message": "Yes TNSe that is pretty much it.  I look at the gear and know the item X is better than Item Y.  But since item Y has hit rating RAWR was telling me it was better even though I am at the 17% cap.  Xemnosyst actually made it very clear as to how it was actually working.  I misunderstood and had it in my mind that once hit cap was achieved the program would prioritze the gear in a \"best in slot\" type hierarchy list.  I think the holy hit cap being represented just added to my confusion and I focused on that.\r\n\r\nI do thank you for taking a look TNSe and thank you for the clarification Xemnosyst.",
