    "Description": "Whenever I attempt to run rawr while will of unbinding is equiped and arcane spec, it tends to run for a long time and the solver log indicated very high dps number, and (if) it finishes the sequence reconstruction will make no sense, with mana starting at zero and evocating on cooldown. Total mana also does not decrease once evocation brings it up.\n \nUnequiping the will of unbinding produces normal results. All three ilvls of the trinket are affected. \n \nI was able to reproduce the error by simply loading my character (laekoth - magtheridon) from battle.net and equiping will of unbinding, enabling sequence reconstruction and genetic solver.",
