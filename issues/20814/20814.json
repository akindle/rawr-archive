    "Description": "I didn't see anything in the documentation or interface, but I'm guessing that my Talisman of Sinister Order is not showing in the exported \"Available\" list because its ilvl (325) is too low.\n \nFor my poor resto set, I still rank that above Blood of Isiset (which is what RawrTree wants me to use as my second Trinket).\n \nIs there something I can do to get the addon to export that trinket?",

Once I manually add it to items, and then \"Update from Addon\", it shows up as available.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Rawr should warn about items that it doesn't recognize (or just attempt an to auto-add them)?",
