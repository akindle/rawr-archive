I get the following error after uninstalling the old rawr4 and installing the latest version (29 Dec 2010) and clearing all the cache stuff, etc etc.\n \n[Arg_NullReferenceException]\nArguments: \nDebugging resource strings are unavailable. Often the key and arguments provide sufficient information to diagnose the problem. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=106663&Version=4.0.51204.0&File=mscorlib.dll&Key=Arg_NullReferenceException\n \n   at Rawr.UI.FileUtils.client_OpenReadCompleted(Object sender, OpenReadCompletedEventArgs e)\n   at System.Net.WebClient.OnOpenReadCompleted(OpenReadCompletedEventArgs e)\n   at System.Net.WebClient.OpenReadOperationCompleted(Object arg)\n \nAt the bottom the loading bar is just about full and the text underneath reads \"Decompressing ItemSource.xml...\"\n \nSearched through the issue tracker, but didn't get much info about it.",

The problem cropped up when I went into the silverlight settings and deleted the application storage (as a form of a total reset).   The big issue is that i can't continue into rawr at all now :(",

The first time, it redownloaded the files because TinkeringCache.xml was missing which is correct and *everyone* going to the website should now see it do that the first time. Since the new DefaultDataFiles.zip doesn't have ItemSource.xml and does have TinkeringCache.xml you should load in just fine.\r\n\r\nAfter you get this error, does Rawr finish loading? Can you get to 'Options > Reset All Caches'?",
