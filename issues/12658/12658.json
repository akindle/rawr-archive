      "Message": "1. Improved Shield won't add a shred of dps as far as I know, since it is not assumed that a mob will hit you. So what would shields do?\r\n\r\n2. I will add Elemental Weapons implementation\r\n\r\n3. The current \"estimation\" model doesn't include glyph of elemental mastery I think; the \"simulation\" model does but is a lot slower. Also, on many fights you won't see a difference anyway whether you include that glyph or not.",
