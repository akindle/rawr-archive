    "Description": "The head of Onyxia quest rewards a ring/trinket/neck piece, but can be completed only once. For some reason Rawr is optimizing two rings equipped at the same time - and this cannot be. Using the Rawr.Moonkin module ver 2.2.27.\n \nThe quest rewards are:\n- Polished Dragonslayer's Signet\n- Sparkling Onyxia Tooth Pendant\n- Purified Onyxia Blood Talisman\n \nThe item itself is not unique equipped, but there is just no way to get more than one of these.",

Blizzard wont bother to mark these as unique equipped, but Rawr might encounter such errors quite often.",
