    "Description": "I was thinking that perhaps we should add an extra effect for SHIFT-right click on an item. At present SHIFT is ignored with a right click and you simply get the expected menu. I thought that it might be a nice touch to have SHIFT-right click open the Equip custom gemming option (assuming the item has gem sockets). \nÂ \nThis would then mimic the action in game to open the gem interface. A small change easy to implement and user intuitive. Could also be added as a tip of the day comment. \"Did you know shift right clicking an item allows you to change the gems on the item.\"",
