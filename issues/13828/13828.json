I instantly closed the program and restarted it, to see if it was a one-off or not. I now can no longer load Rawr itself (working with rev 35973), as it pops up this error approximately 1.5 seconds after the splash loading screen appears.\n \nDescription:\nStopped working\n \nProblem signature:\nProblem Event Name: CLR20r3\nProblem Signature 01: rawr.exe\nProblem Signature 02: 2.2.12.0\nProblem Signature 03: 4a7e6d90\nProblem Signature 04: Rawr.Base\nProblem Signature 05: 2.2.12.0\nProblem Signature 06: 4a7aaa24\nProblem Signature 07: 41\nProblem Signature 08: 0\nProblem Signature 09: System.MissingMethodException\nOS Version: 6.0.6002.2.2.0.256.1\nLocale ID: 1033\n \nWill attempt to create a new working directory of Rawr, first simply copying the existing directory's contents elsewhere, and then will try rebuilding the program from scratch.

I try to bring up that Hunter profile again (loading from the Armory), and I come up with an exception, which I recognize as the same error as earlier.  Attaching the exception text at the end of this comment, and including the loaded assemblies as the first accompanying file.\r\n\r\nI am forced to close the entire program when this error pops up, as the \"loading from armory\" dialogue will not allow me to close it, and the entire thing sort of just sits there.\r\n\r\nMost troubling, as I try to open the program again, that same error pops up.  I can attempt to recompile, but I don't anticipate this fixing the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************** Exception Text **************\r\nSystem.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Single Rawr.Stats.get_MultiShotCooldownReduction()'.\r\n   at Rawr.Hunter.CalculationsHunter.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character, Item additionalItem, Boolean referenceCalculation, Boolean significantChange, Boolean needsDisplayCalculations)\r\n   at Rawr.Calculations.GetCharacterCalculations(Character character, Item additionalItem, Boolean referenceCalculation, Boolean significantChange, Boolean needsDisplayCalculations)\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain._character_ItemsChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 443\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.set_Character(Character value) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 293\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.Calculations_ModelChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 677\r\n   at System.EventHandler.Invoke(Object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n   at Rawr.Calculations.OnModelChanged()\r\n   at Rawr.Calculations.LoadModel(CalculationsBase model)\r\n   at Rawr.Calculations.LoadModel(Type type)\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadModel(String displayName) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 485\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.comboBoxModel_SelectedIndexChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 1774\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.OnSelectedIndexChanged(EventArgs e)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.set_SelectedIndex(Int32 value)\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain._character_ClassChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 315\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.set_Character(Character value) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 281\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character, Boolean unsavedChanges) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 835\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.LoadCharacterIntoForm(Character character) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 829\r\n   at Rawr.FormMain.bw_ArmoryGetCharacterComplete(Object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Raw Data\\35973\\FormMain.cs:line 979\r\n   at System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.OnRunWorkerCompleted(RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\r\n   at System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.AsyncOperationCompleted(Object arg)\r\n****End Exception Text****",
