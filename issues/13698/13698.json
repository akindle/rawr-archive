    "Description": "While I've been impressed with how well along the DPS DK module has come, one prominent problem I hoped would be implemented eventually was that of the Ghoul Frenzy talent. Currently, there is no way to incorporate this talent into your rotation, and it does not currently add any additional DPS to your ghoul with the talent selected. \nÂ \nPerhaps with the upcoming talent changes in 3.2, this one could get a look as well.",
