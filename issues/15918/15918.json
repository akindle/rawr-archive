    "Description": "First of all hello and thanks for the time you all have put into the development of this program. I found and odd problem or perhaps I should say something I do not understand why would rawr change my meta gem from Chaotic skyflar diamond 21 crit 3% increase crit damage to 25 spell power 2% int ?\n \nAlso it changed a few of my gems for haste and spellpower.?\n \nFrom my understand while haste is important to locks the stat to go after are :\nHIT SP HASTE",

      "Message": "It is recommending Haste because you are hit capped. Having more hit than 100% is not going to help. once Hit is capped it will suggest haste/crit as those are the other stats you need to work on. \r\n\r\nThe order is Hit, Spellpower, Haste, Crit. Once full hit is recieved it wants Spellpower, Haste, and Crit. As to the gem..it did that for mine also but it appears it is doing that because it wants me to add more Spellpower Gems. The Chaotic requires 2 blue gems to work and you may get more DPS by replacing the Blue Gems for Red Spellpower gems.",

      "Message": "After looking at the changes it appears it did keep more than 2 blues in your gem slots. Could be that the 2% to intelligence is going to increase DPS. Remember this is a recommendation that it uses to maximize the DPS and it may see 1 or 2 points more with this setup than the other one.",
