    "Description": "Hello, I am an affliction warlock who just started to use Rawr a week ago. I must admit that I am pretty impressed - even despite the fact that you are saying the warlock modeling isnt completely implemented yet, following some of the suggestions (although they were counter-intuitive to me) boosted my dps by 250 on practice dummy (cant wait to put it to the test on tonight's raid!).\nÂ \nThat being said, i am having a hard time using the addons list, mostly because one of my trinkets (Illustration of the Dragon Soul) isnt \"programmed\" correctly as far as I am aware. It looks like Rawr isnt considering it at all, and as an outcome the first 10-15 items it suggests are all trinkets - some of which I know really are inferior to the Illustration. I tried meddling with the item details, but it seemed like numbers were where they needed to be... so unless i tricked it and put in a fake average +spellpower, i wasnt too sure what to do there.",
