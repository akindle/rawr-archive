      "Message": "Screenshot reports 5607 Int, while Rawr gives 5547. Cannot yet place where the 60 int difference comes from.\r\nMy 1st guess is it might be due to interaction between leather bonus, heart of the wild (and maybe meta gem). At this stage they are treated additively, i.e. 11% total. If multiplicative, gives 11.3%, but not yet enough.\r\n\r\nI think we need more testing with different equipped items (does leather bonus drop of when a slot is empty?) and testing stats untalented, might be able to pin-point the exact issue.
