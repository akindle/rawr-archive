    "Description": "It appears to me that the v2.2.2 coding does not use the stat weighting generally accepted by the Elitest Jerks community (see http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t53615-unholy_gains_shadow_death_unholy_dps_discussion/).  Crit gems are always rated higher than haste, which I think should have changed with the haste mechanic change that came in the 3.1 patch.  Can someone that actually understands coding please double check this?",

      "Message": "As has been explained several times, Rawr does not use stat weights in its calculations.  While I am uncertain as to the current status of DPSDK, nevertheless, one should not think that static stat weights will match up to Rawr's calculations in all cases.  The values displayed by Rawr are dynamic based on your current stats, which stat weights fail to take into account.",

      "Message": "Ok, now I a noob because I was not aware that this question has been answered.  I am not much of a theorycrafter, but I think I understand the dynamic values that RARW displays and how they are more accurate than static stat weights.  What I should have said in my original post is that my understanding is that with my current stats/gear, haste > crit when it comes to gemming decisions.  RAWR is showing it the other way around.  I just want to make sure that I understand what is going on.  I have a similar issue with trinkets - RAWR appears to be overvaluing Mirror of Truth.  I was just hoping that that I could get someone involved in the developing the DPSDK model to make sure that it is functioning as intended.",

      "Message": "In the best gear, Haste > Crit.\r\n\r\nBut maybe not in YOUR gear, with YOUR talents, the rotation that YOU chose, and the fight situation that YOU setup.\r\n\r\nGiven the assumptions they make, Theorycrafters on places like EJ forums are probably more accurate than Rawr... but only as long as you make all the same assumptions, with the same gear, and the same rotation. Once you start changing the assumptiions (and seriously, very few people will perfectly match the assumptions of a TCer), there's a good chance that Rawr will be more accurate.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not particularly impressed with the quality of the DK models. It's understandable, considering how complex the DK is, and how new it is, but I'd take Rawr's recommendations with a grain of salt.",

      "Message": "Thanks, MyrddinE.  I understand your point.  What I really want is exactly what you described - a knowledge source that I can use to make gear/gem/enchant decisions that is based on my gear, talents, rotation etc.  I want it to be RAWR because it is so much easier to use than other options, like spreadsheets or websites.  I am just not sure that I can trust what I see in RAWR when it ocassionally seems to disagree with other sources without good reason.  I think that there may be an issue related to the way that hit is being valued, but I can't prove it.  \r\n\r\nIs it possible to turn this into a request for Ebo (or anyone else involved in maintaining the DPSDK model) to confiirm that the recent haste mechanic change was incorporated into the DPSDK model?",

However based on the timing of your post, I am guessing that this was not as a result of your changes.  I am looking forward to the next release - thanks for your help!",
