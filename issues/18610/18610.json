    "Description": "Title: Print upgrade list per body slot\nDescription: I often am raiding and don't know if i should roll or pass on items\nSuggestion: It would be nice to be able to get a printable list of upgrade gear with gem slots (as there is often different slots on H and normal mode gear). As the list would be long, it could be broken down in to which body slot it goes (eg head, shoulders, etc). I think this would be useful during raids as sometimes it is hard to know when to roll or pass and rolling has to be done quickly and it is often time consuming and annoying to switch windows to see programs or websites.\nÂ \nWhat do u all think of this?",
