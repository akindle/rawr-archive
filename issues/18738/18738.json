    "Description": "When i try to load any character it just says \"Queued (Position: -1)\". I believe this is to due the fact that Elitistarmory.com is not working at all for the last week. Version 2 of RAWR works but only on a windows machine. I have a MAC and loved V3. Please fix this to get the information from somewhere or something, please.",
