    "Description": "How about adding another filter for items using the itemlevel?   For instance, in working Ulduar, you can comfortably set your minimum item level to at least 200, if not 213.  Then as your minimum gear level goes up, you can push this up to 219, 226, or beyond.  \n \nAlso, you might consider filtering by item stats.  For instance, as a PVE Arcane Mage, I never want items that have MP5 _or_ Resilence on cloth.  (The MP5 is a no brainer, and the days of farming AV for High Warlord gear to PVE in are long gone).\n \nI think you are already doing some form of weighted filtering on items, because I sometimes see items with wierd negative scores(?).  Perhaps this item selection weighting could be exposed as a dialog?   I could then apply a large negative value to resilence, MP5 -- like I think melee stats already have.",
