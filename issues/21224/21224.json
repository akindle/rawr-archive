    "Description": "For some reason, Rawr will not show my hunter as having anything to do with the listed DPS numbers.  No matter how I've tried to tweak it, even going into the boss simulator to make sure that settings aren't fouled up there, and making sure that the available buffs I've selected are available, it still shows that my hunter is doing nothing.  Please help!",
