    "Description": "I don't use a full-blown flask when I'm doing easy content. However, since I'm an Alchemist I have access to Flask of the North (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47499) and use that when I don't need a big flask. It is basically just the Mixology bonus without actually needing to consume a real flask.\nÂ \nSo far I've just been hijacking the ring enchants since they add up to about the same, but with all the work on profession buff handling, this is bound to stop working eventually and it's pretty inelegant to begin with.",
