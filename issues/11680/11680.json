    "Description": "Currently it's possible to get a shatter bonus for ice lance on a third 'ghost' spell of fingers of frost. I.e. after FoF proc, cast 2 more frostbolts followed with icelance then it will have triple damage and shatter crit. I know that Lhivera did some calculations to show that eventually our gear will be such that you should actually just keep casting frostbolt, but I'd like to see that in Rawr. Is it possible to make a new spell type based on FrBFB but with ice lance included?",
