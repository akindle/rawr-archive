    "Description": "I've searched for items in the cache under edit items (Cataclysm Justice Points gear).  These items are listed but when look different slots to equip there gear is not listed, even typing it in the \"Find\" nothing comes up.  I've even tried to manually add them from Wowhead.  I haven't messed with any of the settings or anything like that, so I'm not sure how I can get these items able to be equipped on my profile to see if they are upgrades or not.",
