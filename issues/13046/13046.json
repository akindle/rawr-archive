    "Description": "Greetings:\n \nIn the post Wow 3.1 releases of Rawr for mage, it seems that Rawr is applying the wrong model for deep fire (18/53/0).  Deep fire mages are very mana efficient, yet Rawr is optimizing and selecting gear, gems and enchants as though it was a high mana need BC arcane mage build.  The result is misselection of gear, lack of dps and unneeded spirit and mana regen.\n \nI like the new talent optimization option, and it created a decent talent build, but the rest of the setup seems bugged.\n \nSee attached file of the optimized build that Rawr created for me - too much spirit and int!  The dps numbers with that build can't be right - there must be some kind of disconnect between the calculated build, and the actual selections.\n \nPlease take a look -\n \nRegards,\n \nmld (Kilicus)",
