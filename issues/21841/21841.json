    "Description": "In the Options pane, under the Burst Style and Sustained Style dropdowns, the main heals are still listed as Lesser Healing Wave & Healing Wave.  I think all Blizzard did was rename them LHW > HW and HW > GHW, and left the spell effects the same, but it happened long enough ago that I don't remember for sure.\nÂ \nIn any case, this probably should be updated to the new spell names, at least so newcomers won't be confused by outdated names (even with the same effects) when they try to configure.",
