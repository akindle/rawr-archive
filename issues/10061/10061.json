    "Description": "Every time I try to use the Fill Socket for Rawr, it gives me an error that gives me the option of closing it or completely ignoring the error and forgetting I tried to use the Fill Socket command.\nUnrelated, but might as well save space/time here, but Rawr loads/edits items really slowly, has it always been this way? I've only found out about it today.",

      "Message": "Um, there's not much to saw as how it's slow. Every time I try to edit an item(such as manually replacing gems), the box/window/whatever it is that lets me do this takes at the minimum 10 seconds(sometimes even 20+) every time, even if I close and re-edit the same item.\r\nMy specs are alright, nothing to write home about. 1.5 GB ram, 2.8 GHz, Radeon X1950 video card, I think that's all the relevant specs, right?",
