    "Description": "This idol was supposed to be fixt in versions 2.3.7 and 2.3.8.  I have downloaded both versions, and in both, it still isn't being modeled.  Is this an error in my Rawr, or is it correct that this idol has not yet been updated?\n \nIf not, is there a way to update it manually?\n \nThanks!",

I had to reload my character from the armory (rather than working off a previous saved one), in order to get the item to properly refresh it's data from the armory/wowhead.  I tried the same feature the other night to no avail, so I've no better explanation.",

      "Message": "As morcego noted, this idol is not quite modeled correctly.  Currently it is providing TWO 5-stacks of 44 crit for a total of 2x5x44 = 440 crit.  The idol actually only gives 220 at max stacks.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, remove the special effects and add a straight up 220 crit rating, of course making the assumption that you will be able to keep this idol's stack up.",
