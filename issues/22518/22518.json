    "Description": "I have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Version: 4.3.8.0 WPF ==\n \n== Error Message ==\nRequested value 'Spirit Beast' was not found.\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at System.Enum.TryParseEnum(Type enumType, String value, Boolean ignoreCase, EnumResult& parseResult)\n   at System.Enum.Parse(Type enumType, String value, Boolean ignoreCase)\n   at Rawr.ArmoryPet.set_Family(String value)\n   at Rawr.ArmoryPet..ctor(String family, String name, String spec)\n   at Rawr.ArmoryPet.GetPetByString(String input)\n   at System.Collections.Generic.List`1.ConvertAll[TOutput](Converter`2 converter)\n   at Rawr.Character.LoadFromXml(String xml)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\nTried resetting all caches and loading again from rawr addon. Same problem.\nWorks fine if I load for the armory. I clicked the force refresh button, but it doesn't have the LFR tier gloves I just received (Wyrmstalker's Gloves).\nTried to load from rawr addon; both are the most recent version\nI don't know why it would complain about the spirit beast. I've had that for a while.\nNo problem with rawr on my other toons",
