    "Description": "I have attached a screenshot of my second screen, this is where I open Rawr during my raids and at other times while I play. My second screen is a 15\" monitor at 1024 x 768 resolution (natural res).\n \nRawr displays perfectly on my main screen, 20\" monitor at 1600 x 900, but I think the cramped look on the smaller screen was unintended :P\n \nMy main issues with the GUI is that as the screen isn't very tall, icons for my bracers and trinkets are shifted into a second column, leaving very little room for the comparison list, cutting many item names short and rendering the most helpful search function completely unusable unless I move it to my larger screen, which I would prefer not to do in the middle of a raid.\n \nI know this is a minor issue, but it's an issue nonetheless. Thanks in advance and for everything you guys have done so far to maintain this amazing program! :)",

      "Message": "I'm using the offline version, so I can't broswer zoom. Using the browser version zoomed so I don't have to constantly scroll around (vertically and horizontally) results in text well large enough to read for me personally, but too fuzzy to make out individual words.\r\nGuess that means I won't be seeing a fix for this soon, I'll make do with what I have. Thanks tons for the super fast response though :)",
