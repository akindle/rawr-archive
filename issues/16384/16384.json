      "Message": "Thank you, that helped a little bit, but there are still problems:\r\n\r\nInsightful Earthsiege Diamond should be available, because it's in ALL enabled gemming templates, but it's NOT available.\r\n\r\nLightweave Embroidery is not listed in the list of back enchants. So I can't choose it.\r\n\r\nSanctified Spellthread is not listed in the list of pants enchants. So I can't choose it, too. Of cause, there is still the opportunity to choose Brilliant Spellthread that has same stats, but Sanctified Spellthread IS missing.\r\n\r\nThe list of ring enchants is completly empty. So I can't choose Greater Spellpower.",
