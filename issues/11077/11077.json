    "Description": "I'm horrible at evaluating how good items are by just looking at their stats so I've made this simple program to help me with adding items that I see on beta server to item cache. It takes the CharacterProfiler.lua and extracts all items on character, inventory and quest rewards. It can also import items by id from Wowhead (either live or wotlk).\nÂ \nIf anyone finds it useful feel free to expand on it.",
