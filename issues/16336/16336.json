    "Description": "I just downloaded 2.3.9 and was about to oprimize my DPSDK.  An optimizer warning pops up that says -\n\"The following slots have a very large number of items selected:\nGems\nWaist Items\"\n \nThe reason I think there's a bug is because I currently only have 1 waist item (the one I'm wearing) marked available.  I've double-checked.  Item filters are at default (should be nothing disabled I think).\n \narmory link:\nhttp://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Dawnbringer&cn=Celas",
