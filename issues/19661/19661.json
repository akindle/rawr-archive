    "Description": "I have a Mage character with Tailoring and Enchanting professions.  When I reload my character - either from battle.net or the rawr addon - the Intellect enchant for rings is cleared so when I try to optimize it tells me that \"intellect is not available\".   Sure enough, if I go to the Enchant -> Finger pager, the Intellect does not have a green diamond next to it.  If I manually click it, everything works fine.  All my other enchants seem to persist in between re-loads of my character.",

Could you therefore provide the steps you took to show the bug so we are 100% clear what you did. DO NOT leave anything out and ensure that you test what you send so you know it gives the bug so we can work out where the exact cause of the problem is. \r\n\r\nI am also curious where the addon comes into this as your XML file is not an addon file, so I have no idea if that is part of the problem. Again details of step by step way of showing the problem will help make sure we can solve it and you don't suffer from this issue in future releases.",
