    "Description": "When I optimize, the optimizer is returning a result with 15.02% hit chance, 1.98% off hit cap. I understand values around .5%, but 2% off cap seems far too great to honestly be the best set up.\nCould this issue be caused by having a 'best' gearset with which it is impossible to attain hit cap, so the optimizer is ignoring it and going for socket bonuses and other stats to try to make up for the gap?\nÂ \nI have attached my character file, thank you for your time :)",
