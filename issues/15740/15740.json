    "Description": "I love this application.  Thank you for all the time and dedication to the project!\nÂ \nOne thing I would love to see more than anything else additional would be the ability to simply upgrade RAWR, rather than having to download a fresh installation several times a week.  Although this is not difficult, I do find it quite annoying since I have to delete version after version along with update my shortcuts and such.  I admit this is a minor annoyance, but how much easier would it be to simply open RAWR and have it pop up the same box stating \"An upgrade is available...would you like to upgrade to version x.y.z?\"  Click \"Yes,\" it downloads whatever changes in code it needs and updates the version tag (not a programmer...might be a difficult task...no idea).  But from a users perspective, this would be an extremely appreciated feature.  Thanks again!",
