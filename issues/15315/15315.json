    "Description": "As I understand it, checking Enforce Gem Requirements should make sure that the meta gem is being activated in a head slot. \n \nOddly enough, it's vice versa in the current build - when activated, only my currently equipped helmet has the meta activated, the other ones listed are greyed out.\n \nOnce I unclick Enforce Gem Requirements, all helmets have their metas activated. In that case, my currently equipped helmet (T9.5, iLevel 245) is also positioned lower on the upgrade list (where I feel it belongs). With Enforce Gem Requirements active, it's placed above all iLevel 264 ones, which seems hard to believe.\n \nI've attached my current build file so you can verify. Thanks for any feedback.",
