    "Description": "If I understood the new Chill of the Throne mechanic correctly, it would not reduce the dodge percentage below 0, and you would at most end up at 0. however, as you can see in the enclosed XML file, my +/- 16% dodge from gear and talents (carefully chosen for no dodge rating) turn into -4% dodge from gear. is this just a graphical display error, or does Rawr actually reduce my avoidance by 4%?\nÂ \nenclosed, you will find an XML file with no dodge rating at all, to illustrate my point.",
