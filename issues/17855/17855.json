    "Description": "My batch tool is setup as 6 character files in these modules in order:\n- Moonkin\n- Moonkin\n- Tree\n- Bear\n- Cat\n- Moonkin\n \nWhen running progressive optimize with maximum thoroughness and max rounds at mid point, the optimization on all character sometimes forget that I have JC gems and profession enabled and wants to remove 1 to 3 of dragonseyes. This happens more frequently on later character files but not as much on the first 2 moonkin files.\n \nThe optimization for Tree, Bear, and Cat (character 3 to 5) doesn't use their respective gemming templates. I usually ends up with Bear and Cat equiping all Runed and Reckless. As far as I can tell, the optimizing was done using the template from the moonkin files, and no dragonseyes.\n \nSee attached zip file for the batch file + all 6 character files.",

      "Message": "If you make sure your first moonkin template has all the gear marked (all specs) then mark every gem and enchant available manually that you need then the optimise will work fine.   It is an issue with the gem templates but I have managed to work around it.\r\n\r\nCan i suggest using two separate batches?  Use one for moonkin/tree and a separate one for cat/bear.    The amount of time you save running the optimises is massive as not only are you doing half the optimises but you drastically reduce the number of items the optimiser has to look at.\r\n\r\n",
