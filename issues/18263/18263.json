    "Description": "The Misc. category in the Refine Types of Items Selection window is too broad spectrum.  Unchecking it removes all cloaks, rings, necks, off-hand-non-weapon and trinkets from the available item list unless the user has already marked that item for availability.\n \nExample: When using the Optimizer or Rawr in general, off-hand-non-weapon items are being populated in the list.  These items are obviously trivial to a TankDK, but by being in the list, it makes it available to the Optimzer and Find Upgrade lists, which can throw off possible legit upgrades for the user.\n \nSolutions:\n1 - Advise user to delete items they don't want manually from the Edit Items DB\n2 - Have each dev code their module to auto-filter off-hand-non-weapon items.\n3 - Create sub-categories for item types that are available to beyond just Shields and Misc.  Create Neck, Ring, Trinket, Off-hand-non-weapon filters.\n4 - Close this issue because it's working as intended, you idiot -Astyllian :P",
