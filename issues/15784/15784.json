    "Description": "\"Quel'Delar, Lens of the Mind\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50047) has the exact same stats as the mace version \"Hammer of Purified Flame\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50051), except for the weapon speed.\nBut if I compare the two items in Rawr, the sword gives me 1073,54 fight healing rating, whereas the mace gives me only 1047,59. The burst healing rating of 648,11 is the same for both.\nÂ \nThis doesn't make any sense. Weapon speed could only affect healing with Seal of Wisdom, but as far as I know the Healadin model doesn't provide an option for meeleing the boss. Also, if this would be the case, the mace should be above the sword (because it's weapon speed is lower), not below.",

      "Message": "I'm not the relevant dev, but I would wager a guess that perhaps it's due to proc triggers? e.g. Judgement would trigger proc opportunities for JoW or other things, but the base PPM chance would be based on your equipped melee weapon?\r\n\r\nJust shooting in the dark here, but I could see it making an ever so minor change.",
