      "Message": "By chart, do you mean the comparison bars in the right pane? I'm not sure how saving an image of these for a single slot would be useful, since what you have equipped in every other slot (and buffs and enchants) affects the item scores you see for the single slot on the right.\r\n\r\nIf it's truly important to you to have a picture of it, Alt-PrtScrn will put a screenshot of the current window on your clipboard, that you can paste into any graphics editing program. (Even MS Paint.)",

      "Message": "You can PrtScrn it, but that's clipped to what's visible.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of this feature would be in being able to show it to other people that don't have Rawr, such as posting on your guild forums \"Look how huge Moonkin Aura would be for me and our other casters - Lets get a Moonkin!\" or \"Notice how big of a jump there is between my current gear and that shiny epic. I deserve that shiny epic!\", etc.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, it'll take like 5min to code it. :)",
