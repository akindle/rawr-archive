    "Description": "I got the MM version of Shandara's modified spreadsheet here: http://elitistjerks.com/f74/t42519-best_possible_dps_shandaras_wotlk_spreadsheet/\n \nI'm using the latest Rawr, 2.3.5\n \nSo, I opened that spreadsheet and noticed that some items, like the Distant Land weapon had an incorrect number of gems slots. I corrected these by removing the gems in those extra slots.\n \nI opened up Rawr and modeled everything in it as it is in the spreadsheet, verifying it a 2nd time with the links given on that post.\n \nI've looked over it several times, enabled all raid buffs possible, and done everything I can think of, but Rawr keeps coming up 621 dps short of the spreedsheet. Even though the pet some how does more dps in Rawr than the spreedsheet indicates, the Hunter does less dps. The only thing I can see that might be different, after looking over it several times, is Beserk is included in the rotation in the spreadsheet; I'd assume this is accounted for in Rawr, but it's the only thing I can see that's different.\n \nPerhaps you could take a look?\n \nFile upload for Jothay to look at.",

      "Message": "I'm gonna have to do a line by line check on why it's different. The Pet is off partially because I'm getting about 200 AP more than the spreadsheet (part of that is from the Hunter having about 200 AP more). I'm thinking it has to do with the difference in Special Effects calcs from us to them.",
