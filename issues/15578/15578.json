    "Description": "It's not terribly uncommon to load a character from the armory, hit optimize, and be told that such-and-such gems aren't available (or enchants), and are you sure you still want to optimize? \n \nSome people may say to RTFM, but wouldn't it be nice if Rawr simply added those categories as available for you? It would be far more intuitive. \n \nIf not, how about changing the error message to mention that the items can be marked available in options? I'd be happy to write that change myself. \n \nhttp://rawr.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=15575\nhttp://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=73119",
