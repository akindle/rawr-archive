    "Description": "Hiho,\n \na friend of mine has an arms warrior who's got recently 70. He wanted to find out which items he can pick for dd-issues from nexus and utgard keep, but when he, and with mine rawr too, only selects these instances there are no other items left than the one he already wears. :(\nRAWR Version is 2.2.22.0\nSame with the Twinks of us, there are categories for the classic content, but no items selectable.......\nIs it an import-issue from wowhead for the german versions or a general one?\n \nYours Sincerely",

      "Message": "Err, half-right. You're not seeing any items there because the default itemcache does not include any items that low level, as Levva said. However, Update Item Cache from Wowhead (or Armory) will not solve that issue. That feature only updates data about items already in your item cache. You instead want to use Load from Wowhead Filter, or Load Possible Upgrades from Wowhead/Armory, or just manually add individual items.",
