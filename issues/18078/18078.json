    "Description": "Today I finally got the Stormchops recipy, I created one for the Outland Gourmet achievement and went to a mob to see what it does. Without using any attack and just standing in front of the mob I noticed Black Magic going up. I waited a bit and I can confirm that Stormchops procs Black Magic. Thing is, you can't have your buff food up and have Stormchops up :( So this extra chance to proc Black Magic + a tiny bit of damage(buffed by raid buffs?) has to be more valuable than 40arp.\nÂ \nStormchops procs are pretty random so I have no idea how you can check the value of increased Black Magic uptime via Stormchops but I thought I should let you know.",

I know the data is extremely limited but in 2 periods of 3min I had 4 and 6 procs of Black Magic by doing nothing but standing in front of 2 Winterfall mobs and letting the Stormchops zap them.\r\nSofar I haven't seen it cause even a single Omen clearcast proc. I'll keep testing for this because I read on wowhead that it did proc Clearcast for a shaman.",

      "Message": "With all the stuff you alread do, the main limiting factor of BM is the ICD.  As soon as the ICD is over it'll proc within seconds.\r\nStormchops might add a few more triggerable events.  But eating a Haste food would do the same.\r\nOverall, the DPS lost by not having a proper food buff will be a bigger DPS loss than the few milliseconds sooner on average the BM proc would go off.\r\n\r\nIf you stand there, on your own, doing nothing at all, then yes, it'll proc BM.  Go actually DPS a few mobs and count how many procs actually happen off the stormchops and not off your other abilities.  You could be doing a lot of time on the mob/dummy before you see that happening.",

I can see some use out of it for aoe situations where you just use Swipe and still get BM procced but than again, you will have to re-eat food buff after every aoe trash pack and who cares about thrash anyways. Still is was fun for me to see Stormchops for the first time :P",
