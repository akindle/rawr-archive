    "Description": "In the latest build on EJ (4.0.13b), my Mage (Xzerqces - Kargath Realm) is showing only survivability in the gear display. No DPS bars are shown. It doesn't matter what I choose in the \"Sort\" pull-down, all the bars beneath are green survivability bars. I confirmed that Rawr correctly recognizes the toon as a Mage.\nÂ \nI have attached a screen capture jpg of what I am seeing with Rawr.",
