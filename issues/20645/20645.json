    "Description": "I am having trouble optimizing with the Jeweled serpent. No matter which trink slot I put it in..It shows as highlighted in both...When removed from either..it is removed from both. If optimised without highlighting in either...it is ignored and when optimized highlighted ..It chooses The serpent for both trink slots..thus giving a false reading and inacurate reforging etc. Am I making a simple mistake or is this something that needs attention ?\nMy other trinkets, once highlighted in one slot , do not appear in the other as an option for example the Bewitching Hourglass as you can see\nI have enclosed snapshots of both slots with the Serpent only highlighted by myself in Trink slot 2 and the resulting optimization showing dual Serpents\nDue to my limited computer skills you may have to enlarge the pic to see.\nMy apologise if I have made a simple error. Thank you in advance for any help",
