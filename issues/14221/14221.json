    "Description": "The parsing of the filters was done incorrectly by who ever looked over the code that was submitted, and as a result the filters now in the 2.2.18 version of Rawr all all jacked up and almost completely useless. The corrected version is still under evaluation, but did not get reviewed before the release of this version.",

They still show up as just <Zone> or Heroic <Zone>.  In light of that, I added the Heroic parsing back into MTRazeR's filters with my patch.  I also simplified the Dungeon and Dungeon (Heroic) filters.",
