    "Description": "If you click on the enchant bar under the item in the \"paperdoll\" you can't just click on the current enchant to keep it like you can in Rawr2.  You can click on any other enchant to select them but not on the one you already have.    It is not a big deal as it is easily worked around (just click elsewhere on the screen) but it is something that bugs me after being used to doing it in Rawr2",
