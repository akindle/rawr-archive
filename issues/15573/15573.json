    "Description": "First I just want to say Thanks for this great tool! I'm exited to see a version that is starting to work on my Mac.  :)  It's looking very nice as well.\nÂ \nI haven't had a lot of time this past week to dig in and test it much yet, but what I did test looks slick. My only issue so far (other than a few items mentioned by someone else about mouse scrolling and such) is that is seems to run unbearably slow for me.  I'm on a 2 x 2.66 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon Mac Pro with 5GB of RAM and NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT.  Anyone else running slow? I would think my system should be more than adequate system. Rawr 2 runs fine in my Windows 7 VM.",

However, we do hope to get it to within ~15% of the performance of Rawr3 WPF.",

It made safari hang with a white screen.\r\nNext I restarted Safari again and asked it to get my toon from the Armory. It got stuck on item 2 of 2.  getting the talents. but I was able to close the safari window this time.\r\nNext, I  loaded a saved file from rawr3 I saved a few days ago. It took 5 or 6 minutes before anything showed up (I just waited this time, so maybe it didn't fully hang on the other tries, but was taking a very very long time.)\r\n\r\nonce I got my toon loaded, I can't say it's any faster.  for example I click on my Back item to see the list of upgrades and get nothing (everything freezes) as I write this, it has still not let me have control back. seems to be hung up again.  (has been several minutes as I write this message)\r\n\r\nBTW, the spinning blue dots with loading % doesn't show up when I first load the page any more. just solid white screen for a minute or so. \r\n\r\nIs there a version display someplace?\r\n",

I have flushed all caches, deleted the application space within silverlight, used another computer entirely, etc with no change in operation. I am guessing it started with whatever update added the ICC gear. \r\nAny operation, such as loading a character from the armory or a saved file, switching to another gear slot, clicking a buff on or off can take a minute or more to update, causing Safari to freeze during the process. It will eventually come out of the freeze and operate again until something else is clicked, at which point it freezes again.\r\nI would also like to see a version number or \"last update\" listed on the front page if possible.",
