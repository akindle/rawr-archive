    "Description": "When I try to change gems on my \"Heavy Clefthoof Vest\" the combined points for the Vest is 886 points, befor the gem change it was 9159.\nI can correct this by swapping the gems back as they were, but thats not the way it is on my druud.\nThe gems swapped is \nGlinting Noble Topaz -> Glinting Noble Topaz (Unchanged)\nEnduring Talasite -> Glinting Noble Topaz \nShifting Nightseye -> Solid Star of Elune\nTryed it many times but cant get it to work with the gems I want.\nÂ \nThanks in advance and great work you do\nBarlybear of Runetotem (A)",
