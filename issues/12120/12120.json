    "Description": "All really minor, you guys have done amazing things with this simulator.\nÂ \n1.  Glyph tabs have no tooltips, and sometimes tips from other tabs bleed through.  Certain hotspots (e.g. right after Glyph of Arcane Blast:) will sometimes give the tip of \"Optimize between mage and molten armor\".\n2.  I could be missing it, but is there a way to account for the critical strike chance in Loatheb (50% increase for X% of the fight?).\n3.  Minor trinket problems.  I can't get Thunder Capacitor to load, or \"fix\" the stats on Meteorite Whetstone (rawr says it has a 111 haste rating, and this disagrees with wowhead).",
