    "Description": "Ticking Imp.Moonkin form and Windfury totem both sets buff.PhysicalHaste to .03 & .16. However the combined haste is being processed as multiplicative ie: (1.03*1.16)-1 = 19.48% ie: buffs.PhysicalHaste is set to .1948 Now my understanding is it should be additive ie: 19.0% Physical haste. I'm at work and unable to get in game can anyone confirm that from nothing adding these two buffs gives 19.48% or 19% haste. If Imp.WF is talented then it would be .03 & .20 which means results are 23% Physical Haste or 23.6% Physical Haste.",

      "Message": "Haste stacks multiplicatively and haste rating stacks additively with itself.\r\nBonus Haste = (1+(Haste1 %)) * (1+(Haste2 %)) * (1+(Haste% from Haste rating))\r\nIn your example: improved Moonkin Form and Windfury totem gives you 1.16 * 1.03 = 0.1948 haste. (19.48%)\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is whether improved Windfury stacks multiplicatively with Windfury or not. From what I understand, the spell effect of the talent should be a flat bonus of 4%.\r\nOur buff selector lists improved Windfury Totem as 3.45% which gives 1.16 * 1.0345 = 1.20002 bonus haste from the improved totem. Although a bit clumsy, the value is correct.\r\n\r\nWith both improved Moonkin Form and improved Windfury Totem pesent, your bonus haste from these buffs will be 1.03 * 1.20 = 1.236. (23.6%)\r\n\r\n",
