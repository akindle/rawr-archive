    "Description": "Corren's Chromium Coaster is showing as less of a boost to my hunter's DPS than the Mirror of Truth, when they are absolutely identical items.\nÂ \nThey have the same 84 crit, the same on-crit effect, and aside from the name do the exact same thing, yet somehow it's showing Mirror of Truth as a boost to DPS - I believe something is wrong in the calculations, or the item stats for one of the two items.",
