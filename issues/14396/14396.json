    "Description": "The quest rewards from handing in the Head of Onyxia are not unique, they do not need to be as the head can only be handed in once, but this creates an issue for Rawr. I have a Polished Dragonslayer's Signet and when I select it in the optimizer, it suggests that I equip 2, obviously not possible. Easily fixed manually, but confused the hell outta me when I saw it at first :P",
