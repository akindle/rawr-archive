      "Message": "We need some more information, crash can mean a lot of things.\r\n1) Does it reach a point and just sit there for a bit? Have you tried waiting longer (in case it's just needing to make an intense calculation)?\r\n2) Do you get any error messages?\r\n3) Do you have a log in your Rawr folder in the form of a text file named DEBUGME or something?",

      "Message": "Sorry for the very few informations.\r\nBy crash i mean: \r\nWhen i start the process (with maximum thoroughness) the label in the bottom left corner states: \"-1E+07\" instead of a percent value, the taskbar icon states 0% for a very long time and the hole system barely reacts and even the taskmanager only reacts very slowly (this shouldn't be a hardware issue with my system, because usually when i use the optimizer i can still fully utilize my system) \r\nWhen i put the \"Thoroughness\" skale at the minimum the finishes very quickly without an error.\r\nWhen i put it just a little further right it first states \"-1E+07\" as the percentage value but after a short time there is a real percentage value, but still it stops at some point or becomes very slow (didn't let i run for more than ~3 minutes).\r\nBefore this update the process took with maximum thoroughness about ~3-5 minutes\r\n\r\nSo no i don't get any error since the process doesn't terminate and no errorlog",

      "Message": "The problem only occurs sometimes, or for some characters.  It occurred only when you have 2 arp effects and try to get your arp uptimes without a weapon equipped, which the optimizer sometimes will consider.  Simulated Annealing should be used as a temporary workaround until the next release.  Checkin #44637 fixed this problem.\r\n\r\nTo clarify some points: it isn't a crash, it just takes a while to process.  No weapon equipped led to a trigger interval of Infinity for your arp procs due to a bug, so the Arp uptime calculation freaked out and did 20 iterations rather than ~2-4.  You can still cancel, and it will eventually stop, although if you're not worried about losing unsaved changes, you can just kill the process to speed it along.",
