    "Description": "When I load a character using the Character Profiler data, it picks up all the bank items except the off-hand items.  The data is in the file.  It picks up the off-hand being worn.  It is somehow just missing the ones in the bank.\n \nv2.2.2 Mage\n \nP.S.  Love Rawr!  Love the Character Profiler option.  I have one request for using the Character Profiler data.  Can there be an option to green diamond the profiled items rather than blue diamond red dot.  I'm a bit of a pack rat and it takes some time to switch them all to green.  ;)",
