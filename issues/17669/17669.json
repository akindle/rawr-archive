    "Description": "Is there a current issue with the \"install offline\" button in rawr 3? Clicking the button from within IE8 or Chrome does not seem to be working for me. No errors or anything. I have installed on a different computer in the past and everything worked at that time. Just curious if it was disabled because of the issues with .16 or (more likely) an issue with my computer.\n \nSorry fixed the Install offline by rightclicking and uninstall this application...seemed to install correctly this time. But now have an issue where the only items i see on the right pane are items i currently have equipped. No filters appear to be on.\n \n*edit*   And resetting the item cache seems to have fixed it.",
