    "Description": "I just tested the new 2.2.14 and loaded my toon into it. The first thing i saw was that the overall score was way below, what it used to be in the previous release. Then I changed talents - using the template already there (FB - 18/53/0 ) and the score increased. But the only changes is that I've left out 1 point in Flame throwing and 1 point in Master of elements in favour for a total of 2 points in student of the mind and 1 point in Arcane Medtitation.\n \nI figured this might be, so I used my own specc, and made it identical to the template in RAWR - The overall score is still the same 'low' one as my initial specc was..\n \nTo sum it up, there is a total of 700 overall points differ the two indentical speccs..",
