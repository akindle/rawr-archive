    "Description": "We need to add some distinction between held in hand items and off hand weapons and how it applies to enchants. Currently the optimizer will select an enchant on offhand slot even if the solution includes a two hander or a held in hand item that can't be enchanted.",

      "Message": "Yeah, I noticed this when running the optimizer on my mage. It had selected Sunfire for my off-hand item.\r\n\r\nFor mages and warlocks (at least) we can't hold anything in our off-hand that can be enchanted. This needs to be taken into account in the optimizer, most likely simply by disabling the Off-Hand Enchant selection completely from those modules.",
