      "Message": "Hmm, no immediate plans to do this directly, indirectly you could save your character once for each custom rotation. It has its downsides as you having to add new gear you own multiple times for each rotation. Otherwise you could probably open the XML and manually copy-paste. Not really helpful but I have to think this over.",
