    "Description": "Hey, as my title says, rawr isn't displaying gems that are mixed (i.e. spirit/sp, crit/sp, etc), just the pure ones (23 sp, 20 str, 30 stam). Could someone tell me why this is?\n \nVersion: 2.3.6\nType: moonkin model\n \nFile attatched which is the one I'm looking at. I've tried quitting and reopening Rawr, didn't work. I've tried opening a new character, still can't change gemming, so it's not a localised issue.\n \nThanks!\n \nJarob",
