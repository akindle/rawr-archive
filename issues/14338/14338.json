    "Description": "Regarding the \"Hide Enchants Based on Professions\" - it's not working correctly.\n \nWhen initially loading an existing profile in under the latest build, all profession-related BoP item enhancements are hidden.  When going into Options, toggling the feature anddictating the professions keeps all hidden.  Turning the entire thing back off enables standard Rawr functionality.  Playing with other professions besides the ones I actually have does not help.\n \nCan attach Character Profile if requested.",

      "Message": "I would like to reopen this issue.  Under 37713, profession-specific item enhancements are still not being activated given that \"Hide Enchants Based on Professions\" is toggled on, and any given professions are selected.  For example, even though Enchanting, Engineering, or Inscription may be set as one of the two professions, the ring enchants, boot/glove/back gizmos, and shoulder inscriptions are not showing in their respective places for selection.  Only when the Hide Enchants selection is toggled off do the item enhancements become available again.\r\n\r\nThis happens on both existing profiles, and freshly loaded characters.",
