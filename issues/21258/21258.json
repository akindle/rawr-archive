    "Description": "The interaction between the source filters and the Item levels filters is inconsistent. If all sources and item levels are deselected the charts should show only equipped/available gear however it will still show the 391 iLvl rep rings when it shouldn't. Selecting all the source codes does not change anything (working as it should?) until the item level is ALSO selected. However if the process is reversed by selecting item levels first, the chart will be populated and the source filters will have little to no effect. Able to reproduce this on 3 different toons using 5 different models (Hunter, ProtWarr, DPSWarr.Fury, Retribution Pally and Holy Pally) so it should be reproducable on any non-dev. builds.\nÂ \nOn a slightly different note both Warrior and pally models have Magma Plated gear listed, I corrected this locally by editing the pieces for the DK class but it is a minor inconvience each change.",
