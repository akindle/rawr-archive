    "Description": "When loading my char in via the addon or just from armory I'm getting a issue where it is saying the char is capable of 1k DPS, 2k after Optimizing. This is since new release. Is there something wrong with the module or is it something I now need to adjust I'm not able to find any info on this elsewhere. I had a friend load his alt warrior too with same results. I'll attach a file if you need it.",
