    "Description": "Current beta (2.2.0b5) of RAWR reliably hangs when I am attempting to optimize my mage.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\n \n1) Fresh unzip of RAWR, delete any residual RAWR folders in AppData\\Local\n2) Load attached character file\n3) Attempt optimization to maximize DPS rating, maximum thoroughness\n \nCrash will occur at various points in the optimization but generally within the first 10-15% of the process. Turning off multithreading does not make a difference. Character XML file was generated by loading from the armory and flagging gear as available. Only gemming template selected is \"Rare (Jewelcrafting)\". The hang is simply \"RAWR has stopped working\" as identified by Windows.\n \nOS: Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit.\n \nAdditional notes: Same crash occurs in version 2.2.0b4. Crash does NOT occur in 2.2.0b3. Additionally, crash does NOT seem to occur using 2.2.0b5 under a laptop running Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit.",

The top progress bar just stops moving?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to assist in debugging this problem I would ask you to install Visual C# Express and try running from the source. Contact me through codeplex here if you would like to assist and I'll provide you further information.",
