      "Message": "The *best* way to do it would be to compute damage taken without the proc, damage taken with the proc, and then weigh them together with GetAverageUptime when the effect has a stat that is nonlinear.  You can optimize this by only doing that calculation on capped stats if the proc causes you to surpass the cap (ie, a +1% hit proc when you're only at 3% hit can use GetAverageStats; if you're at 7.5% hit, you should do two separate calcs and then weigh the results based on uptime)\r\n\r\nstats += effect.GetAverageStats and stats += effect.Stats * effect.GetAverageUptime is a BAD thing to do while dealing with armor penetration (exponential return), defense (soft cap), hit/expertise (hard caps), and probably dodge/parry as well (due to DRs on them).",
