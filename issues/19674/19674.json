I'm not that into Resto Druid, neither into rawr's code in order to be shure how this should be calculated. Removed the comment, Left pure Intellect (It complains it can't find talents.lunaguidance), and immediatly the enchants were corrected (Of course the values must be way out the correct). \r\n\r\nI don't know if the maintainer is already on this, but if not, i'll try to get a formula for SP from intellect later tonight.

The model seems to be a lot more innacurate than just the SP issue. Mastery is also not added to calculations, and, can have some weigth on final calculations. \r\nI thought this model might be stalled, but latter on i saw the Broker's last check'in was Feb, 4.th, so i guess i was wrong.",
