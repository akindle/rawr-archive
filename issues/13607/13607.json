It should be in the 2.2.10 release.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question about your friends warrior, I'd bet that he doesn't have 2/2 Unrelenting Assault and you did.  The bug had to do with calculating the number of slams you did to proc the 2pc.  We needed to know the number of slams, which means we needed to calculate how often you use every ability.  In that, we were looking at Overpower's cooldown instead of how often it procs, and Unrelenting Assault lowered the cooldown to 1sec, which means it thought you were overpowering once per second and doing negative slams :P",
