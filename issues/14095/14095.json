    "Description": "After loading a character from the armory, then running the optimizer, the percent complete will go up to 100%, DPS estimate will increase, but the window showing the optimized gear will never pop up. It will stay at the optimizing window, indicating 100% complete,  with the cancel button and close button forever. Pressing cancel at this point has no effect. Pressing the close button will close the optimizer window and rawr can continue to be used, although I never know what the optimizer determined. \nI have tried this on 2 different Macs running different versions of the OS and browsers. I also downloaded the rawr applet directly and it does the same thing.\nDisabling popup-blockers or any other security measures has no effect.\nAm I missing something?\n \nMac #1\nMac OS 10.5.8\nSafari 4.0.3\nLatest Firefox\nSilverlight 3 (3.0.40818.0)\n \nMac #2\n10.5.7\nSafari 4.0.2\nLatest Firefox\nSilverlight 3 (3.0.40818.0)\n \nEDIT: It appears that this problem occurs with any mage I load from armory. If I load a feral druid, pressing the optimize button does nothing at all. If I load a holy paladin, everything works properly.\n \n11/10/09 Edit:\nHappened to try this on another Mac, which was running OS 10.6. Same problem. Also tried it running Windows XP and Firefox under Parallels 5.0 on the same Mac. Same problem. I have never been able to get the optimizer to show an optimized items window for a mage under any circumstances.",
