      "Message": "i arrived home and tested it on my personal PC. It seems to work very fine. Maybe it is something with my office computer. Anyway i cant provide any more details because i didnt do anything diferent at home and office.\r\nAbout crash at work: it freezes(\"this program is not responding\") only when adding imporved power word shield. Any other talents works fine. And my office pc has better configuration than my personal computer(so performance shouldn't be an issue).\r\nI dont have any other details. Maybe the program gets in a conflict with some corporate tool that runs in background(so maybe you shouldnt bother more about this problem)\r\n\r\nThanks bye",

If it still happens on your Work computer then, then there is a real problem. If it stops happening, it might be a problem with an old data file.",

The program hanged, i had to leave the office and when i cam back after 10 min it was working (dehanged). Working is maybe to much said since the Imp PW:S icon was Samwise Didier's face.... I unlearned talents, relearned them... at any rank 1/2/3 i see samwise face. If it's unlearned i see normal icon.\r\nHere is a pic. with what i see at work.",
