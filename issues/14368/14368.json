    "Description": "Due to the fact that in 3.3, Triumph badges are going to be the new base set of badges I decided to set up a list if items for my priest with just Naxx 25/Triumph badges. After creating an Optimized set, I looked at the 60 spell rotation and noticed that not once in that rotation does it apply Shadow Word:Pain. If there is one place that it needs to be placed, it's after the first Mind Flay (since that would allow 5 stacks of Shadow Weaving be in place before placing a SW:P on the target).",

      "Message": "That is because the model does not include Rampup or Rampdown casting. If you got Pain and Suffering it will assume you have already cast SWP at max stack of Shadow Weaving. Think of it this way, its not modelling the first 6 seconds nor the last few seconds of a fight, just the middle part which is by far most important. If you want to see how much damage each spell is doing, there is a seperate chart. (DPS Sources)",
