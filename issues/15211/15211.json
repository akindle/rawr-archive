    "Description": "I'm not sure if this is a bug that is causing T8 2-piece to be over-valued. Having dots a chance to proc clearcasting makes the 2-piece worthwhile. I understand that. However, when I hover over the set bonus when I have a 2-piece selected (in my case Conq helm and gloves though I do have a full set with val legs and shoulders and conq chest), it says \"2 Clearcast on Bleed Chance.\" It is my understanding that we get a free single clearcast from bleed, not two. Are you referring to say casting shred two times on clear cast (as an example). or are you referring to having 2 clearcasts proc back-to-back? Because no matter what I do, it seems like I cannot get rid of T8 unless I have all Triumph gear or T10 gear.",
