    "Description": "I used the optimiser with the condition that I not be crittable, and ended up with 534 defense.  My understanding is that I require 540 defense to be uncrittable.  It shows me as having no resilience, no defense food/elixirs.  I do have the boss set to level 83, and don't see any set bonuses/proc effects that increase defense.  Is this an error in my understanding, or in the model?",

However, you could still be crit without Holy Shield up. I believe that is why there is an additional 'Defense Skill' optimizer criteria for if you do not wish to balance around that fact.",

      "Message": "EvanM is exactly right. It is how Negarine and I had written that aspect: there are situations where you can use holy shield to push off crits.\r\n\r\nThe solutions are as follows: disable \"Use Holy Shield\" for the purpose of the optimizer, or use \"Defense Skill\" as the optimization criteria if you really want to see the whole 540 deal. Or do both.",
