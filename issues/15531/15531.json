    "Description": "Seems like the unique check for Nightmare Tears is broken in 2.3.3, at least partly.\nIf I use the optimizer, everything is ok. But the comparison list shows items with a Nightmare Tear if I already have one equipped. And it even shows items with multiple Nightmare Tears in one item.\nÂ \nYes, \"Enforce Gem Requirements\" is checked.",
