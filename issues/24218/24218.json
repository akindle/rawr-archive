Current, i'am unknown, if it gives new Items.\r\n\r\nFor me intressting, how work's the Updateting Item Cache? Is this a manuell process?\nIf this a manuell process, why use not the api to get all Items from wowhead/buffed/speedydragon?\nSo the work for Updating will be smaller.\r\n\r\nI know, programming need many hours. I will say you, you has my respect.\r\n\r\nRegards Tarantulas",
