    "Description": "Looking at my character in RAWR 2.3.15, I've noticed that my Crit is now being valued at 2.64. This not only seems a little high for my gear level, it's also about double what I'm seeing on the Online Beta version of RAWR. Not sure if this is a bug or if something changed that I wasn't aware of, but it's throwing off the value of any gear or gems I try to Optimize.\nÂ \n.xml attached",
