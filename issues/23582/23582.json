The problem appears on Safari, Chrome and Firefox.  I've tried clearing the Silverlight data associated with Elitist Jerks, restarting browsers, restarting the machine and doing a disk permissions repair all with no result.  Both machines I have tried it on have the same issue.  Problem occurs on both the US and EU armouries.\r\n\r\nAll in all, seems like it may be external, i.e., Blizzard have changed something in the armoury.",
