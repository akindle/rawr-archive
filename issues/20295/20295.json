    "Description": "Sometimes the Relative Stat Value shows haste above mastery, probably because it's close to give rupture another tick or something. Therefore the Deft Ember Topaz can be a viable choice at specific times.\nAn example where haste is valued more than mastery is the attached assassination rogue.",

      "Message": "I didn't know how haste affected rupture, so I assumed that haste was above mastery because of another tick. I just tested it and noticed that haste didn't affect the number of ticks, it lowered the total uptime. So I guess Rawr tries to balance haste and mastery out a bit since more haste gives more Venemous Wounds' ticks and mastery increases the damage of VW.\r\nThat makes haste even more interesting compared to mastery, and I believe the Deft Ember Topaz is more viable than I thought earlier.",
