    "Description": "Hi, with 2.3.1, rawr gave me wrong item score, which cost me a few bucks.\nUpdating to 2.3.2, the item thing seemed to be fixed. But the enchants are wrong again.\nFor example, as a dps dk, I am using Arcanum of Torment for head. Well, rawr told me that Arcanum of Ferocity was the best for me. How could that be possible?\nChecking out all enchants of my items, seems like everyone is wrong.",

Otherwise, they can't do much to help you identify the problem.\r\nOn another note, I had a similar issue with both dpsdk and enhance modules.  The issue resolved itself when I reloaded my character/s from the armoury and saved to a new .xml.  I suggest trying that.",
