    "Description": "Per http://elitistjerks.com/f78/t83763-proc_items_needle_encrusted_scorpion_et_al/#2\n \nDiffs from current:\n - Needle-Encrusted Scorpion - 50 sec ICD instead of 45 sec\n - Revered/Exalted Ashen Verdict rings - 1 PPM instead of 10% proc\n - Deathbringer's Will - 'Proc rate is \"about\" 50% - might be a bit lower (say 45%) but it's definitely in that ballpark.' (quote from site)\n \nWhispering Fanged Skull appears correct.\n \nI don't know if Heartpierce is right or not.  I haven't poked around in any modules that would use it.\n \nThis thread seems a likely place to track for future melee trinkets as Aldriana is a very well respected melee theorycrafter.",

I can test all three as well\r\n\r\nDeathbringer's Will - I'm not able to find any information on proc chance on any of the database sites. Wowhead is the only one that states it is a server-side script on the proc. Again I can try to get an estimate on the proc chance.",

      "Message": "Aldriana is compiling results of hundreds of hours of combatlog tests done by EJ forum users, and his results are reviewed by the community.  As far as WOW is concerned, you will not get more reliable information.  Specifically, the proc rate of ICC items was kept unreleased for months, until sufficient statistical proof was gathered to get enough confidence. You will not be able to repeat this process by yourself and you will be most likely wasting your time.\r\nIt's true there is always a chance of error, but it's small enough that I would just do the change as fast as possible and worry about it later.  For now, it looks like you have wrong data for items used by many classes for almost a year...\r\n",
