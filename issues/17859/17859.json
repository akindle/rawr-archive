    "Description": "I was looking at my Death Verdict on my druid and I noticed that it's providing a \"45000% Blood Strike Damage Multiplier.\" The Heroic version is giving \"51000%.\" I'm not questioning if it is providing a Blood Strike Multiplier, I'm just questioning how high it's set to. I'm just confirming that this is correct or if I need to go in to change it to another percentage.",

      "Message": "No it's an itemcache issue (or was at least).\r\nIt broke in the last itemcache Astrylian made (13may) merging Dyzek's stuff. So probably something went wrong in the merging. Or Dyzek just messed up editing the item cache manually.\r\nIt's fixed in the itemcache MTRazer checked in a week or so ago.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story: don't manually edit the itemcache ;-)",
