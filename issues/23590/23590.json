    "Description": "While trying to figure out why I couldn't get my equipped stats to match my in-game stats, I back-tracked all the way to untalented-unglyphed-no-gear and found that the base stats don't match between Rawr and the in-game values.  Here are the what I'm seeing in-game vs. what Rawr reports:\n\nStat   In-game Value   Rarw Value\nStamina           115                   120\nMastery            15%                  8%\nHealth        155346           155416\nMana         300000           240000\nCrit                1.92%         -1.08%\nMana Regen   6214  \nCombat Regen 6000          3000\n\nStats that Match:\nAgility           91\nIntellect       165 \nSpirit           190\nSpell Power  155 \nHaste           0%\nHit                0%\n\nAdding the talent, \"Heart of the Wild\", stamina and health diverge a little more\nStamina    121     127\nHealth    155,430   155,514",

I think a number of these issues are fixed, or at least, I couldn't reproduce them with respect to the mastery, spell crit, and mana ones.  The stamina one I am just fixing, and should be checked in momentarily.",
