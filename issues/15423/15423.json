    "Description": "On v2.3.2 and loading my old Enh. character file, I came across an awkward gear recommendations, such as recommending [Snowstorm Helm](Resto. gear) over [Snowserpent Mail Helm](Enh. gear).\nAfter some efforts to adjust this, I unticked 'Use Mana Calculations' in the Options Tab, and it came back normal, at least what it used to look like.\n \nI don't precisely know what that option does, but my guess is that RAWR concludes my character needs more mana regen. to DPS fully between SRs, which in reality, is not true for I still have about 20% of mana left when my SR is back.\n \nI consider this could be an issue.\nMy char. file attached for reference. Thank you.",
