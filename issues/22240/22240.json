    "Description": "Hi, I thought I already raised an issue but I can't find it so maybe not.  I get differences between gear shown as higher on usual character import screen from rawr wow addon to gear in the optimiser.  I am not at all teccie and I can't understand why this would be.  I have valor points to spend and I am really not sure what is best.  Would be most grateful for some help.   I attach a screen showing head item, with optimiser upgrade screen over the top of the character screen",
