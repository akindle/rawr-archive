    "Description": "I get the No character returned from armory error when I try to load my toon.   I followed your trouble-shooting steps as best as I could.\n1. Yes it worked on my old versions, but then it stopped working so I deleted them & downloaded the new version.  \n2. I am not use a proxy or domain.  \n3.&4. Armory is up & running fine - I can go to the website & view my toon perfectly.  \n5. I don't think its an item issue since I can't load the toon at all.  \n6. My toon's name doesn't have any special characters & can't load any toons, mine or friends.  \n7. I tried with firewall turned off.  \n8. User agent is already Firefox2.  \n9. I uninstalled Norton, used the Norton removal tool, & even had the Symantec tech support remote access my computer & remove all remaining files (He said they were just temp files so wouldn't be the problem & suggested I contact your tech support).  \n10. As stated in 3/4 toon displays fine in armory.\n(11.?)  Followed your directions re creating a System.Net.log (see attached)  Really hoping you can help me figure this out.",

      "Message": "Ok, I finally figured out how to fix the problem.  I had to open Internet Explorer (even though I've never used or opened it ever before) & click Tools, Internet Options, Connections tab, LAN settings, & uncheck proxy.  Seems a virus/trojan/malware/spyware/whatever it was that had gotten on my computer, had changed this setting.  When the virus had been removed/cleaned, the proxy setting thing was not fixed & even though I never use IE & Firefox2 was selected as user agent, it was still messing with my ability to get data for whatever reason.  Hope this helps some of the others out there with the same problem.",
