    "Description": "I took a look at the Insightful Earthsiege Diamond gem, cause it really does look to be undervalued for resto druids in Rawr. First I replaced the triggered effect with a bonus of 60MP5, this is a conservative estimate, but it sent the gem's value way up. That's odd, right? Then I twiddled with the value for MP5, and a value of 18 MP5 made it comparable to how it's currently estimated.\n \nThen I looked into the code, the effect is (I think correctly) modelled as a SpecialEffect with a Trigger.SpellCast, and Stats.ManaRestore = 600, duration 0, cooldown 15, chance 0.05. But when the tree model evaluates it, it calculates the getAverageProcsPerSecond and adds the ManaRestore (PER SECOND) to MP5\n \nCalculationsTree.cs, line 420:\n \nMp5 = resultNew.Mp5 + resultNew.ManaRestore\n \nThat last bit sounds off. Shouldn't it multiply the ManaRestore procs per second with 5 before adding it to the MP5?",
