    "Description": "I appreciate this is mentioned under Troubleshooting but I thought I'd just post to say that the following items prevent (my?) character from being loaded into rawr from the armory\nItem 25549 - Blood Knight's Tabard\nItem 24143 - Initiate's Shirt\nRemoving these items from the toon allows the Load from Armory to take place correctly.\nThis has worked correctly until 2.3.13\nI also receive the same error if I attempt to load a saved copy of the character containing these items. I've no idea if it makes a difference but I'm updating item cache from armory now just in case.\n \nActual error(s) as posted:\nStep Name: Get Item\nDescription: No item returned from Armory for 25549\n \nStep Name: Get Character\nDescription: Rawr encountered an error retrieving the Character - Jerec@EU-Aszune from the armory.\nAdd'l Info: Generating a Rawr Character\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at Rawr.Character.RecalculateSetBonuses()\n   at Rawr.Character..ctor(String name, String realm, CharacterRegion region, CharacterRace race, BossHandler boss, String head, String neck, String shoulders, String back, String chest, String shirt, String tabard, String wrist, String hands, String waist, String legs, String feet, String finger1, String finger2, String trinket1, String trinket2, String mainHand, String offHand, String ranged, String projectile, String projectileBag)\n   at Rawr.Armory.GetCharacter(CharacterRegion region, String realm, String name, String[]& itemsOnCharacter)\n \nThanks",
