    "Description": "Right now the Character Profiler and File Picker dialogs share a directory; navigating in one moves the other.\nÂ \nSince these two folders tend to be fairly static, would it be possible to remember two different folders for these file pickers, so one doesn't have to constantly renavigate?",

      "Message": "Let me be a bit more explicit.\r\n\r\nI grabbed a copy of the source code I got rawr-35987.zip, which doesn't seem to be the latest\r\nversion, since the call to LoadFromProfiler() function in FileMenu_SelectionChanged() was commented\r\nout...)  (all this is in the Rawr3/Rawr.UI/MainPage.xaml.cs file)\r\n\r\nBut in the OpenCharacter() function calls the OpenFileDialog() microsoft method.  This class is\r\ncapable of taking directory arguments, so differerent uses of the file dialog can start in different\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nSee this example: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.openfiledialog.aspx\r\n\r\nThe FileDialog superclass has an InitialDirectory attribute that can be set before ShowDialog() is called.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the LoadFromProfiler() method to \"maintain\" a different place in the directory tree\r\nfrom the \"open/save\" character dialogs.  This means if you both open/save a char, and load from\r\ncharacter profiler you would not need to renavigate the tree.\r\n\r\n",
