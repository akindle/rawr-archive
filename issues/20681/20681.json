    "Description": "So i downloaded 4.1.04 and at first i thought it crashes whenever i use *import from battle.net*. Then i tried to load another char and that worked. So problem is when i try to import my paladin via battle.net it crashes with windows saying it's sorry blabla. What may cause this?\nÂ \nTried it on different computers with xp and win 7 and it only happens on my char. - Santhoi in Frostwhisper server.   What i think is that downloading from battle.net isn't the problem but loading something in that info makes the program crash. Maybe an item that is not in the list or something similar.",

Lemme track this in the Importing Server to see if I can make it read your professions correctly",
