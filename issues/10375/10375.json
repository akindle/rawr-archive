    "Description": "So I've just started testing out the new modules, and I loaded up my tankadin (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Icecrown&n=Yukinojo). Rawr.Tankadin incorrectly reports her as crittable, despite having a 493 Defense. I understand there has been some argument about Resillience + Defense at edge cases, but there is no argument whatsoever here: 490 Defense Skill is uncrittable vs. bosses, period. The module reported chance to be crit at 0.48000001%.\nÂ \nI have some programming skills, though I've never used C#, so I will be looking at the source code myself to figure out what might be causing this... but like I said I've never used C# so if someone else gets it done first that'd be great, heh.",

      "Message": "The tankadin module is not done and is not accurate. I started making it, but shortly afterwards I quit WoW, so it is unlikely to be finished.\r\n\r\nBut, the bug is purely a display issue. I changed the calculation code around that it calculates avoidance and defense while taking into account the enemy's level. Then what outputs the results originally was displaying results from when it didn't take into account the enemies level, so it does there too. I updated this in my local version, but I didn't do one last checkin when I quit.\r\n\r\nTo fix it yourself change this in CharacterCalculationsTankadin.cs\r\n            if (CritAvoidance == (5f + levelDifference))\r\n                dictValues.Add(\"Chance to be Crit\", ((5f + levelDifference) - CritAvoidance).ToString()\r\n                    + \"%*Exactly enough defense rating/resilience to be uncrittable by bosses.\");\r\n            else if (CritAvoidance < (5f + levelDifference))\r\n                dictValues.Add(\"Chance to be Crit\", ((5f + levelDifference) - CritAvoidance).ToString()\r\n                    + string.Format(\"%*CRITTABLE!
