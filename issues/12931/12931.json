      "Message": "This is a known issue, involving the difference between \"relevant enchants\" and \"relevant items\".\r\n\r\nAt the moment I set the item filters to show only \"tanking items\" with defense or avoidance stats (since no item, other than trinkets, would not have defense or dodge or bonus armor on it) but since we use stamina and agility enchants, there's a separate criteria for enchants.\r\n\r\nIt appears the optimizer is still out of sync with support for IsEnchantRelevant.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix would be to set Stamina and Agility and Strength as relevant stats for all items, but since 95% of all items have stamina, we'd go back to huge equipment lists with a long list of items at the bottom with little value except for its stamina.",
