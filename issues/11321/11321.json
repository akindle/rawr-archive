    "Description": "The optimizer is giving me worse gear combinations that what I am wearing on my hunter.  I have selected the items I am wearing and several possible upgrades.  After running the optimizer, it tells me it found a gearset with a score of 491 and the gear I have equipped is 939.\n \nThe optimizer settings are:\nCalculation to Optimize: Overall Rating\nNo additional requirements\nThoroughness is set to max\n \nAttached is my character file.  I created a new character file by downloading my hunter from the armory in b16.1.  I have been having the same problem since b16.",
