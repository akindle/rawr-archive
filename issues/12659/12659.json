    "Description": "When a glyph of renew is in force on a priest, based on my testing and calcs, the +healing calc is reduced by 10%, i.e. if you have +1000 sp, then you would calc with +1000*1.88*.9 to find the total healing.  The base amount of the heal at +0 sp doesn't appear to be impacted by this change.",
