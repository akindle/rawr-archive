    "ClosedComment": "To quote the developer of the Moonkin spreadsheet&#58;&#34;With queue delay set to 0.3, 400 haste will be exactly where the cast time of an un-NG&#39;d Wrath crosses 1.5s. This causes the uptime of NG to jump up, because the sheet starts assuming you can fit in 3 Wraths per NG instead of 2. So I think the concept is accurate, but like all haste breakpoints &#40;GCD softcap, Reign of the Dead&#41;, it looks sharper on the sheet than it will play out in practice.&#34;In other words, while definitely confusing, this behavior is intended.  One will just have to use some common sense when picking items around the haste discontinuity, which varies by latency.",

    "Description": "Ok, I might be wrong on this one, but my boomkin is hit capped and over the 401 haste. However, Rawr is still recommending (bracers) Savage Wound Wrap (blue, ilvl 200) over Esteemed Bindings (epic, ilvl 213 with +19 SP gem), and I can't figure out why.\n \nComparison (Savage vs. Esteemed):\nArmor: 127 / 253\nSP: 51 / 79 (including GEM)\nHaste: 43 / 37\nSta: 31 / 42\nSpirit: 0 / 39\nIntel: 32 / 38\n \nRawr gives 182.97/182.97 rating for Savage, and 179.87/179.78 rating for Esteemed.\n \nTried updating both from Armory. No change.\n \n \n \nI'm attaching my toon XML file.",

Using the Savage Wound Wrap takes you over 25% character haste, which puts your NG'd Wrath at the global cooldown.  It appears there's an edge case right on this 25% haste boundary that I need to find and fix.  It'll be in the next release.  Congrats on finding a very obscure bug.",

As a workaround, adjust your latency; the \"bump\" in the haste chart is at least partially related to your latency value.
