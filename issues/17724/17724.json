    "Description": "It is painfully obvious with the 2.3.17 release that the filter display is not intuitive.  What I mean is that users see a check mark in the upper level of a filter and assume that means everything below it is also checked.  however, this is not true for RAWR! and therefore people are submitting tickets when none are called for (I have seen 2 in the last day).\n \nI suggest changing the check mark only system to a check mark if ALL sub menu items are also check marked or a shaded box if only some of the sub menu items are checked.  Obviously if no sub menu items are checked then the upper menu can be empty.\n \nThis will make the filter menu system more intuitive to the users because this is the method most O/S GUIs use.",

We could use an external control library, but that would be massive overkill for this feature which is intended to be obsolete.",
