    "Description": "hey, my boyfriend plays a mage and loves this program, but for priests it just seems to have a number of issues and always get answered by 'its not put in yet, or fixed yet' or something along those lines. I understand that it takes time, and that iwouldnt be able to do it. I just want to know if this will be a program i will ever be able to use. it just makes me sad when mages get set bonuses updated like right around patch day, and we are on the next set of loot and the t8 stuff hasnt been put in yet. \nthank you for your time",
