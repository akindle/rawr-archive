    "Description": "Threat/Damage calculations for abilities seems incorrect.  In the above listed class on line 239 we have:\n \nbaseDamage *= (critMultiplier * AttackTable.Critical); \n \nwhere AttackTable.Critical is the percentage chance of a critical strike.  Shouldn't this be:\n \nbaseDamage *= (1.0f + critMultiplier * AttackTable.Critical);\n \nIn the source code, ability damage looks correct until it gets to this line, but then it's being multiplied by a number far less than one (around .34 in my case) which is making overall threat very nearly 1/3 what it is in v2.2.13.",

      "Message": "I did a little more in-depth investigation of this one.  Going over the history of the file, it actually was like this before in revision 33274.  It was removed in 36040 without any comment as to why.  On a second pass through, I figured out it was because the damage of the original formula was too *high*.\r\n\r\nTo explain this, let's assume a 100% crit chance this time, 1000 base damage, and a 1.5 crit multiplier.\r\n\r\nbaseDamage = 1000 + 1000 * 1.5 * 1.00 = 1000 + 1500 = 2500?!  You're not supposed to crit for 2500 on an ability that does 1000.\r\n\r\nSo in short:\r\nbaseDamage *= (critMultiplier * AttackTable.Critical);  is wrong because it multiplies the entire damage (base plus critical) by the critical strike chance when it should only be multiplying the critical damage.\r\nbaseDamage += baseDamage * critMultiplier * AttackTable.Critical;  is wrong because it adds the entire damage (base plus critical) to the base damage.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes from how critMultiplier is being used.  The critMultiplier is what you need to multiply to the base damage to get the actual number you see when you crit.  For instance, a 1.5 crit multiplier on a 1000 base hit leads to 1500 damage.\r\n\r\nBut the formula is trying to calculate the critical damage only, which is the damage above and beyond the 1000.  Since the only place critMultiplier is being used is in this formula, we can safely knock 1.0 off all the crit multipliers in the section above.\r\n\r\nThis makes the formula  baseDamage += baseDamage * critMultiplier * AttackTable.Critical;  right because now baseDamage * critMultiplier * AttackTable.Critical is the average crit damage, not the average hit.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've uploaded patch 3752, to deal with this issue.  Sorry for the confusion, math sucks. :)",
