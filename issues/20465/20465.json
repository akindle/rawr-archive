    "Description": "I was wondering if there was any interest in creating a filter that would block items with certain stats from being displayed. This would mostly be a quality of life change. For instance, [Stormwake, the Tempest's Reach of the Wavecrest] appears numerous time on my comparison window on my mage, as do the other Al'Akir/Conclave weapons, due to all the reforging options. I understand that in extreme circumstances, taking an epic item with spirit would be a substansial update over, say, a green with just intellect. But, in most other instances, the items with spirit take up an unnecessary amount of room.\nÂ \nLike I said, this would be mostly to clean up the \"clutter\" on the comparison windows of most classes. For instance, I often see spellpower leather when goofing off on my feral druid. Being able to filter out gear with intellect would just be awesome.",
