    "Description": "Hoping I'm not double-posting, but searching Discussions and Issues with \"moonkin,\" \"T11\" and \"Regalia\" turned up nothing on the issue I seem to be experiencing.\n \nThere appears to be no DPS value associated with the two-piece set bonus for moonkin T11. The four-piece set bonus shows a distinct DPS gain, both in looking at the value of the fourth piece and when looking at the Buffs: Set Bonuses tab. The two-piece shows 0 value on the Set Bonuses tab, and no discernible gain on the Gear tab.\n \nI figure three possibilities: I'm missing something (quite possible), 5% crit to moonkin DoTs is of no effect on our DPS (which I find unlikely), or there's an issue to be fixed. Would love to know which if any of these are correct.",
