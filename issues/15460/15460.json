    "Description": "It would be possible to let two instances of rawr to be open at the same time??\nI usually miss this feature because i have one rawr open with my BiS config for my main spec, to remember if i need something from a specific boss during raids and i would like to let another one open with my BiS config for my off spec to know if i need something for it too.\nI know that i could just write it down but , from my point of view(and i dont know a thing about the rawr source code), seems like a pretty easy thing to change on rawr to let another instance to be opened.",
