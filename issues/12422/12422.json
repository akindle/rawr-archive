    "Description": "Whenever a new version is downloaded and run for the first time, Rawr pops up with some release notes welcoming and giving information about this new version. Well this is a nice idea but it's just far too big. The OK button is off the bottom of my screen for a start and the width of the dialog makes for a lot of very long, single-line paragraphs. I'm sure this could be more readable with a scroll bar, for instance similar to how the Blizzard Downloader/Installer is displayed.",
