    "Description": "I know it goes against everything Rawr and certainly understand if the devs decide not to implement this on principle, but it would be of some use to me (and I assume others) to be able to see the GS of the current equipped gear in Rawr.      Having so many alts, guild runs of ICC aren't enough and I have to PuG.      GS sucks, but I am forced to deal with it, because with out a minimum GS, I can't get into ICC.    Being able to plan upgrades to get me to a \"magic\" GS to get me in the front door becomes an essential part of gearing up my toons.   \nÂ \nI can certainly live without this as it isn't hard to work out that the bigger the iLvl increase the bigger the increase in GS, but it would be convenient to have the info visible.",

I did a search and there were no other issues (open or closed) with the keyword \"Gearscore\" other than a post made by you about armory problems.\r\n\r\nThe others may have been deleted, but it doesn't matter - it was just a thought and I can see that it doesn't fit in with Rawrs reason for being.\r\n\r\n",
