    "Description": "Since Mastery and avoidance so far, gives you nearly the exact same results, can you provide an option for DK's to choose mastery over avoidance under the optimizer? I see on the calculation to optimize, area under additional requirements nothing regarding mastery.  I have preferred mastery so far on my DK and would love to be able to choose this as an option over avoidance.",

      "Message": "The last version I used was 4.1.02.  I have not tried to load my DK up yet on 4.1.03 as for some reason it usually takes a little bit of time after downloading the newest version before the program can access the internet and poll data from the armory OR lookup items from wowhead if you use the addon or a save file to load your character.\r\nAnd yes my internet connection is fine. I can run both .02 and .03 at the same time and .03 wont work and .02 will. I  know this is a seperate issue and I havnt looked through the current issues yet so if you'd like the error log, I can open a new ticket if you wish with that info.",
