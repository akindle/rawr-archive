    "Description": "Silverlight version of Rawr. When attempting to load character from Armory (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Suramar&n=Glaras), the progress dialog shows the Character is downloaded, but the Talent Tree hangs immediately after identifying the spec (\"RestoSham\" in this case). The download cannot be cancelled, and the progress dialog cannot be closed. This occurs in both the online and offline versions. No error messages are given.",
