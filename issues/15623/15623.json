    "Description": "I find that, after downloading a new version of Rawr, the item cache is often screwed up. I need to restrict it to Heroic- and Emblem-only gear, and so much of what ends up on my lists is wrong that I have to go item-by-item for like half an hour to weed out stuff that isn't supposed to be there. It would be nice to either be able to reload a group of items simultaneously from the Armory (or WoWhead) or to be able to have it only update its cache for items that are upgrades in the current model I am browsing. Or any other way to make fixing my item cache upon every new release easier. :)\nÂ \nThanks!",
