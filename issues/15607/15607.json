There's still some data we're missing, particularly the proc chance, just tagging this as an issue to be dealt with, when the info is available.",

      "Message": "Note that at current Shadowmourne even with the effect added won't be properly valued in Rawr.Retribution.\r\n\r\nNone of the currently available triggers match the actual abilities the proc happen for (they're all too low).  There's also no provision for the currently possible 'trick' where you're cancelling the STR buff in order to get more chaos bane procs for more DPS. I'm going by the assumption this \"clever use of game mechanics\" is actually a bug waiting to get fixed soon. so don't expect to see this being modelled at all.  Given the proc mechanic, I'm also guessing this trick is only going to be usefull for ret to give more DPS.\r\n\r\nFor ret at least, I can assure you it's BiS by a wide margin, regardless of where Rawr curerently estimates it at.",
