      "Message": "Please follow the posting guidelines, by attaching character files.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, note that the values you see on the armory should not match what you see in Rawr, as the armory shows avoidance against level 85s, whereas Rawr will show avoidance against bosses (typically). There should be a difference of ~0.6%. That doesn't explain most of these differences though.",
