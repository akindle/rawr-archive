    "Description": "I am used to the JC Gem warnings, but now this issue seems to be carrying over to gear that I change since Battle.net character loads.\n \nSteps to reproduce:\nFile - Load from Battle.net - <insert toon name etc.>\n \nToon is shown with gear - Change 1 or more gear Pieces to a different piece of gear\n \nTools - Optimizer...\n \nSelect: Calculation to Optimze: Burst DPS Rating - Check Override Reenchant - Slide Thoroughness to maximum - CTRL click Optimize\n \nAnd I am given the error: \n \nThe following currently equipped items are not available\n \nStormrider's Shoulderweraps is not available\nOBsidian Arborweave Vestment is not available\nFirescar Sash is not available\n \nDo you want to continue with the optimization?\"\n \nNote: The gear names are simply the most recent attempt I have made to try and optimize my gear.  Usually I can just put the gear on in game and Load from Battle.net but today the armory is being a pain to update so I am trying, yet again, to just make the gear swaps in RAWR with no success once I get to the optimization process.",

      "Message": "This is by design. Optimizer requires you to mark gear as available to be considered in optimization. If you have something equipped but not marked available you get the above warning. All you have to do is click on the diamond next to the items in question.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, it would be very useful to add a third button that marks the items for you automatically and continues with optimization. I'll see about adding that.",
