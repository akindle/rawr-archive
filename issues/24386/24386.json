    "Description": "On my moonkin (Carnacki - Nagrand), if I try to use the optimizer it displays a dialog box warning that the currently equipped items are unavailable, then it lists all my items that I've spent VP upgrading. I clicked the Yes button to \"make them available and continue\" but it just loops displaying the same dialog box over and over. Clicking \"No\" actually seems to run the optimizer but it treats the items as 522 ilevel not 530. So the calculations can't be right.",

I haven't even begun to touch the code that would be necessary to run them through the optimizer and do other things like evaluate which piece to upgrade first.  I do apologize for the inconvenience, especially since I know item upgrades are a thing this patch and everyone is interested in them.",
