      "Message": "I'm assuming this is using 2.3.8 and not the latest unreleased code?\r\n\r\nThis is an already reported issue in 2.3.8.  We're releasing a new version very soon, which will have this fixed.\r\n\r\nThe bug occurs when your crit chance for an ability reaches 100% (which means you're also expertise/hit capped -- as arms this is easy to do, as Overpower cannot be dodged and has a +50% bonus chance).  Fury can also be affected if you somehow got Slam/HS/BT/WW to 100% crit chance through extreme crit gear and glyphs/talents.  \r\n\r\nAny time you reach this point, DPS drops.  Agility, Crit Rating, Hit and Expertise can all be affected (expertise is less likely)",
