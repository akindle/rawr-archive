    "Description": "It seems that percent bonuses to block value are additive and not multiplicative stats for protection warriors. I've tested this with Eternal Earthsiege Diamond (21 defense rating, 5% block value), Glyph of Blocking (10% block value) and Shield Mastery (30% block value) and my numbers add up perfectly assuming that the total multiplier is 1.45 instead of 1.05*1.10*1.30. This is also the case when only two of the three bonuses are active. Rawr however treats block value percent bonuses as multiplicative and thus block value shown with 2 or more of the mentioned bonuses is incorrect.\n \nAs an added anomaly block value is also not floored like most stats are but rounded to the closest integer.\n \nAll this should be fairly easy to verify if you can find an armory profile with both Shield Mastery and Eternal Earthsiege Diamond or try it out in game.",
