    "Description": "Sorry for opening another ticket. The other one was closed and I didn't know how to reopen it, or if I even could, once I added my comment.\n \nSo after the last update to Rawr 4.1.03, I'm still having problems saving/loading to/from the Rawr4 repository.\nLoading the toon Lunarwolf from US/Thorium Brotherhood from b.net then going to File>Save to Rawr4 Repository... gives me the following error:\n \nI have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Version: 4.1.3.0 ==\n \n== Error Message ==\n[net_uri_BadHostName]\nArguments: \nDebugging resource strings are unavailable.
