      "Message": "That's because a prot paladin is supposed to have 102.4% total mitigation + avoidance.  This is spelled out quite clearly in most protection paladin guides I've found.  I think it is due to a boss being 3 lvls above us and our base miss % going from 5% to 3.6%, but I haven't found that answer yet.  Your stats are at 103% with full food buffs/elixirs and one-time pots.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the optimizer had you choose that Metagem in your head slot, but it is the worst of the three choices.  A) You already have run speed in your talents, so that portion of the metagem won't stack.  B) The 81 stam + either block or armor are better mitigation than 54 mastery (this math is done at elitistjerks).",

      "Message": "@boarder1999: Thanks for the bump.  Your confusion about 102.4% vs 100% is addressed in several other threads in the Issue Tracker.  The Blizz UI calculates avoidance vs a level 85 boss.  Rawr calculates avoidance vs a level 88 boss.  The difference is 0.6% miss, 0.6% parry, 0.6% dodge, and 0.6% block, i.e., 2.4%.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for an individual to roll back to an older prot paladin model or an older version of rawr?  I would like to get useful optimizations again.\r\n",
