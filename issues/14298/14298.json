    "Description": "Hello,\nÂ \nas I know by now, it's a known issue of Rawr v2.219 that the Gem chart is not accessable. My problem right now is, that the optimizer uses gems I dont want him to use (Dragon Eye's) and I can't tell him not do that. Shall I download an older version of Rawr and change the gem settings there, or is there any other workaround?",
