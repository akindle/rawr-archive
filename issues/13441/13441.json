    "Description": "The \"new version released\" dialogue always causes a crash in mono, so that it is impossible to use an older version on a Mac.  The error dialogue also crashes so I haven't been able to get a copy of the error message; however, the issue has occurred in all previous versions of Rawr that I'm aware of.  Would it be possible to simply disable the new version notification manually?",
