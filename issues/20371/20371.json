    "Description": "I have Rawr 4.1.1.0 (via Silverlight) on two machines, one of them is missing the correct \"Filters By Source\" and lists only \"Rare\" and \"Other\" as the two filter options.  The other PC lists correct list of \"Filters By Source\" as:  Dungeons, Heroic Dungeons, PVP, etc.\n \nThe filter options are the same whether I view Rawr via ElitistJerks in Chrome or locally via Silverlight.  It doesn't seem that OS would be relevant here, but the \"broken\" Rawr is installed on Windows Vista - Business, while the \"working\" Rawr is installed on Windows 7 (32-bit).\n \nAnd yes, I have tried removing and reinstalling. :)",
