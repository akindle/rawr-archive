    "Description": "I noticed that, for my current gear set, Rawr seems to be valuing Mastery over Dodge. This is happening on the MT model, OT model and on the optimizer.\n \nSince the Savage Defense nerf, I keep hearing that mastery is not so good anymore, and that dodge is much better, but not Rawr is telling me otherwise. The only possible explanation I can see for it is diminishing returns. Anyone got any idea for this ? Here is some of my char data, hoping it will help (this data is post-optimizer):\n \nDodge: 34.326%\nMiss: 6.4%\nArmor Damage Reduction: 53.405%\nTotal Damage Reduction: 66.787%\nAvoidance PreDR: 43.768%\nAvoidance PostDR: 40.726%\nSavage Defense: 67.002% ~ 20086\nTotal Mitigation: 88.505%\nDamage Take: 11.485%",

Not, of course, as much as you would like, since I did put HP >= 160000 on the optimizer to make my healers happy (and yes, I know they are wrong, but it is a lost fight, since the raid leader is one of the healers), but still the minimum I could get away with.\r\nIn any case, I think I get your point. I will try running a few models without any stamina and see if I get a better feeling of what is happening. I will let you know here how that turns out.\r\n",
