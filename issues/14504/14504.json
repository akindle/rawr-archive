    "Description": "The tooltip for Blade Ward (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=64441) indicates that it does 600-800 damage on a parry after it has procced.  However, the list of main hand enchants in rawr for prot warriors is broken down by Survival, Mitigation, and Threat.  In this list, Blade Ward's value is shown to be exclusively due to its increased Mitigation (avoidance, really).  Since Blade Ward does damage, damage is threat, and there is no indication from rawr that Blade Ward adds any threat, this leads me to believe that Blade Ward is not modeled correctly.  What am I missing here?",
