    "Description": "Well i tried to optimise my hunter as a beast mastery hunter but here's the problem i have. However i try to optimise his DPS when i take a look at the DPS section of the stats, aside from autoshot, all stats stay at 0. I made sure that there was a shot rotation but it still say 0 DPS from the shot rotation.\nÂ \nAside from this problem, i suggest adding an option in the hunter optimiser that allow to optimise both the hunter DPS and it's pet DPS at the same time. That'd be especialy useful for beast mastery hunters as their pets are a huge part of their DPS.",
