There doesn't appear to be any info in the XML from Wowhead or Armoury that we could use to parse the data. This is quite annoying. Perhaps we could add a Faction flag to the item anyway and have a FactionItems.xml file that had entries such as <Item id=47300 faction=\"H\" /><Item id=47104 faction=\"A\" /> It would need to be manually created for now but would save a lot of FAQ questions like this.",
