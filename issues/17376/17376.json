    "Description": "So I use rawr primarily for finding BiS for non raid gear for my characters, this means that I filter out all raids, and only filter in heroics and emblems of triumph.\nÂ \nYet when I do so and look for best in slot, it will display the teir x.5 pieces which require a armor token which you get from raiding. Armor token is a filter, and i have disabled it, so why does it show up :( is this by design?",
