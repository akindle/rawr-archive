    "Description": "This week, For both addon and website, when toon loaded from Battlenet, some old items are not being found in WoWhead.  Toon's stats are not calculated correctly; reforging not calculated.  For example, 359 Power Generation Hood for Malynn-Hyjal is not showing reforging.  Malynn's hit is being calculated at 5.84% when it's 16.81%.",

I'm not good with computers, which is one of the reasons I love Rawr.. it's so easy to use.  Here is my mage from the armory:  http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/hyjal/malynn/simple    I hope the file below is what you need to see my toon as it appears on Rawr.",

However, when you mouse over the icon, there is a note at the bottom of the pop-up window that says it isn't found in WoWHead (I think it's the geming/reforging combinations that are not found).  The hood is just one item of several items that are this way for my toon.",
