    "Description": "These two spells freeze the client and force me to alt+ctrl+del out of the client to shut it down when I insert them on the Warlock spells priority list and only those spells. This effectively stops me from reviewing my DPS as either Affliction or Destruction, as these two spells are an essential part of their rotations. I look forward to a fix.",
