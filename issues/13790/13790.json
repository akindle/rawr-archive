    "Description": "The crit damage calculation in ProtPaladin adds an extra 100% critical damage (so spells are modeled as critting for 2.5 damage, and melee for 3x damage) and thus gives vastly inflated values for crit. This has been in there for  a long time, I think.",

      "Message": "You can't see it directly in the output, only the symptoms (the inability to easily audit the models is a weakness in rawr). For example, look at the value of the talents for threat. Sanctity of Battle (3% crit) is worth more than Crusade (3% increase to all damage). This is simply impossible. I looked at the source code to find out why it was getting this result and the answer is that the protadin model calculates crit bonus damage incorrectly.",
