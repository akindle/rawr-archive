      "Message": "I played around with my sheet and compared a few values, it appears to be a combination of a couple issues, the only buffs in game/on the sheet is frost presence, these intial values are also done with zero talents selected (as Toughness also may be bugged):\r\n\r\n1) Austere Earthsiege Diamond - This is undervaluing the amount of armor that should be granted. Without my helm/meta and all other gear on / no talents, I have 25546 armor on both the rawr sheet and in game. When I equip the helm I have 29461 armor in game, but 29280 armor in Rawr.\r\n\r\n2) Toughness - This also seems to be an issue: In game, without any talents/no helm/meta I have 25546 armor, matching Rawr with no talents/helm. When I spec 5 points into toughness, I now have 27619 armor in game. In Rawr I only have 26842 armor.\r\n\r\nBoth the meta and the talent appear to function, so its not an issue of them not working at all. The issue seems to be with how the talent/meta are being layered in with frost presence. Just an offhand glance, it seems like frost presence isn't being applied to the talent/meta, and that it probably should be.",
