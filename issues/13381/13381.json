    "Description": "I have some issues with the Optimizer and a Enchanted Tear gem. It seems like it applies the unique constraint to both the current gear and the optimized gear.\nÂ \nWay to reproduce it:\n1. Create a gemming template for Retribution model that contains an Enchanted Tear in the blue socket.\n2. Load my attached Retribution character.\n3. Note: Enchanted Tear is shown active in the boots (although with no stats, is this by design?) and meta gem is shown active.\n4. Use the optimizer with max. thoroughness.\n5. Now, in the current gear section both the Enchanted Tear and the meta gem are shown inactive/grey (the optimized gear uses the Enchanted Tear in the helm).\n6. Press the \"Keep existing gear setup\" button.\n7. Now, the Enchanted Tear and meta gem are shown inactive/grey in the character section too!",
