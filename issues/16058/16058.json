    "Description": "I had the Dark Coven Hood equipped and wanted to tell Rawr that I also had Gul'dan's Hood of Triumph (the 245 iLvl version) but only the iLvl 258 version appeared in the list. I checked the item in the Item Editor and it was there and available to Warlocks and to Horde, I couldn't see anything wrong in there that would stop it being displayed. I also checked the Item Filters to make sure it wasn't being filtered out (it wasn't). So I thought the best way around it would be to equip the item, log out, reload my character from the armoury and go on from there, but having done this the Dark Coven Hood no longer appears in the list. I did all the same checks as before and couldn't see anything wrong. I checked the other item slots too and in each case, Gul'dan's Regalia wasn't listed unless I had it equipped, the iLvl 258 Gul'dan's gear always appeared in the list, just not the iLvl 245 stuff. Am I being a bit dim here or is something broken?",
