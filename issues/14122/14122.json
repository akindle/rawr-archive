This is a huge problem and brings rawr unusable for shadow priest, and proyect \"shadows\" over the calculations in haste/hit/crit . I think that could by a good idea a brief explanation about what is the stage of development on Shadow Priest. If is necesary to wait, no problem, but are noticiable to developers the issues on the Shadow Priest?",

I also implemented the currently known changes for 3.2.2 as well.\r\n\r\nI'm still struggling with T8 4 pc bonus, but I'm going to take a crack at it tomorrow. If it doesn't work out neatly I'll try to make it work out badly atleast :P",
