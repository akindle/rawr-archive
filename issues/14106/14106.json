      "Message": "Update - using r36595, OH is still bugged somewhat.  It works if it's selected through the dropdown dialogue... sorta.  All OH are counted as 0 DPS.  With just a MH equipped, the comparisons tab for the MH shows a nuch of green bars filling the width of the comparisons pane.  When selecting the OH options for the comparisons pane, I get the following error, and a nice big red X and a red box where the list normally is.\r\n\r\n----\r\nSystem.OverflowException: Overflow error.\r\n   at System.Drawing.Graphics.CheckErrorStatus(Int32 status)\r\n   at System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString(String s, Font font, Brush brush, RectangleF layoutRectangle, StringFormat format)\r\n   at Rawr.ComparisonGraph.get_PrerenderedGraph() in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Version-Separate Data\\36595\\ComparisonGraph.cs:line 564\r\n   at Rawr.ComparisonGraph.OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) in E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rawr Version-Separate Data\\36595\\ComparisonGraph.cs:line 681\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.PaintWithErrorHandling(PaintEventArgs e, Int16 layer, Boolean disposeEventArgs)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.WmPaint(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.WndProc(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.WndProc(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl.WndProc(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.UserControl.WndProc(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlNativeWindow.OnMessage(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlNativeWindow.WndProc(Message& m)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow.Callback(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam)",

It seems there was another spot where offhand logic was added *cough*Jothay*cough* and not tested for the case when OffHand speed was 0, but it wasn't getting hit when below a certain DPS.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Ubah, that WhiteDPS issue was also fixed in the more recent checkin.\r\n\r\nBrWarner, if you get a chance, try your scenario again with r36596",
