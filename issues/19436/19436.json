    "Description": "When I try to load my Elemental shaman, it brings up all my gear and the correct spec.  But the simulated dps is 1 and the bars on the side for equipment that will normally tell me \"Sustained DPS\" or \"Burst DPS\" are not visible.  It seems like there is an issue with computing the DPS.  When I switch to Enhance or to Resto the bars engage and it shows new equipment that would be upgrades, but for Elemental is just show all the gear and shows it doing 0 dps to include the 372 gear.  I did a search for the forum about other elemental shaman with the issue and didn't find much but it could be something that affects other classes too and was in that post.  I've tried Rawr on my other toons and works just fine, just not my elemental spec.\nRawr: Rawr4 V.4.0.12b\nCharacter: Shammerr\nServer: Shadow Council",
