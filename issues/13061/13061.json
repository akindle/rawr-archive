    "Description": "This issue is happening (to me at least) since the first rawr.enhance beta I've tested, In the begining it happened with both main-hand and off-hand weapons, but some builds ago started to work correctly for main-hand weapons. Attached you can find a composed screenshot where the issue. Charachter is Meganegasuki@Tyrande(EU). I also noticed some discprepancies with trinkets like caster trinkets being valued way over melee trinkets at the same ilvl but due to the caster/melee nature of the ehn shammies this could be right.",

      "Message": "The graph issue I'd noted but have yet to work out why this is I think it might be part of the negative values issue ie: one item has a negative value for whatever reason and the graphs go wild. The fix for this is a reworking of the graph routines rather than anything in the model. Although changes to the Windfury model in v2.2.0.10 will help eliminate the weirdness of haste suddenly going negative at 1.49 hasted speeds.\r\n\r\nSo not sure I can fix the graph issue right now, my focus is far more on trying to get the base model right. Caster trinkets being high valued changes back and forth depending on gear equipped. I've narrowed down the dps calcs a lot since v2.2.0.9 and this will help. As you say given our dps comes a lot from spells caster gear being slightly better in some cases is not surprising. I do believe there needs to be a few tweaks though to get the figures matching EnhSim a bit better. This may swing things a bit more in favour of melee but may not. The figures in v2.2.0.10 are looking fairly decent, only out by a few percent, but there are a couple of things that I need to work on to nail down why they are different.",
