    "Description": "Feedback from EJ:\n \nThe problem with haste for healers seems to be that RAWR assumes you chain-cast through the fight where in actual gameplay healing has a rhytm with bursts and breaks, so you actually spend more time getting mana through mp5 than spending mana on heals. Would it be possible to add a time spent casting option in addition to fight lenght? So if you set the fight lenght to 10 min it gives you mana regen for that period but only simulates casting spells for a set period of time. This could make haste values for healers more realistic.\n \nTLDR: We want an Activity field in all caster models.",

      "Message": "This is not true. Specially for healers haste has value because it improves response time and throughput. You don't need to be casting all the time for throughput to be important. Tank might be taking near zero damage for a long time and then he enters a burst phase where he takes a lot of damage in short time and burst healing and therefore haste is important in such a case. Additionally haste helps against pushbacks as it reduces the time when you take the full 1 sec pushback.",
