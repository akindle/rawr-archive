    "Description": "I often use the Upgrade List because it gives me a very good and structural overview over my possible upgrades. But since 4.1.03 every time I create an Upgrade List the list shows me \"upgrades\" which are definitly not upgrade for me because the actual equipped item is very very better.\n \nI'm not quite sure if this is something like a new \"feature\" which I maybe don't unterstand or a real issue but I find it really confusing.\n \nAttaching my character file and the build upgrade list.",

Before the patch I didn't see my marked items because they were the best items which I had at the moment for this slot. Now there are a lot of items in the upgrade table which are worse than my equiped items (=the highest item with the green diamant in the table)",
