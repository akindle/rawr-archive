    "Description": "I have been looking at the new sequencer (currently build 18087) in Rawr.Mage and I'm seeing it pop SCB and then shortly afterwards use a mana gem. Seems like it is modelling SCB for it's +spelldamage and mana gem for the mana return, but not combining the two effects as one action. Is this only a problem in the sequencer? Or is the spell cycle analysis also counting these as separate actions?",

      "Message": "This is only the problem with sequence reconstruction. The solver makes sure that all SCB pops are paired with mana gems so you won't have SCB+flame caps for example, but at the moment it doesn't ensure any temporal interdependencies. Right now I don't have a fleshed out idea how to make this special case work so I wouldn't expect it for b14.",

      "Message": "Ah, I didn't realise the sequence is a reconstruction. \r\n\r\nMy guild is currently working on Brutallus and I was hoping to use Rawr as a tool for execution plan. Normally as arcane fights are flexible enough just to burn cooldowns asap. E.g. AP+IV+Icon+SCB early on; evocate and cold snap as trinkets come up again. But with a 6 minute fight I need to plan my mana much better, and coordinate with the shaman what is the best moment for mana tide. Also heroisms will be towards the end of the fight for the fire mages. Well you know what I'm talking about of course.",
