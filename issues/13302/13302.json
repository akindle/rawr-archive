    "Description": "The DPSDK model is not calculating Heart Strike correctly.  It is also calculating the effects of the DK DPS T8 4pc bonus incorrectly.\n \nHS is currently calculated as: Weapon damage * ( 50% + 5% per disease ) * ( 120% if 4pc T8 ) + 368 + any other bonuses for HS\n \nIt looks like it should be calculated as: ( Weapon damage * 50% + 368 + any other bonuses ) * ( 100% + 10% per disease * 120% if 4pc T8 )\n \nThe attached patch fixes the HS calculation accordingly.\n \nReferences:\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f72/t40287-rawr_discussion/p6/#post1247600\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f72/t40287-rawr_discussion/p6/#post1247876\nhttp://www.wowwiki.com/Heart_Strike",

The other three affected abilities, however, do have the issue with the additional percent damage from diseases only applying to the weapon damage.\r\n\r\ndkabilities1.patch corrects the disease damage handling for the other three abilities (OB, BS, and SS).",

This is contradictory to the description of the abilities in game and on wowhead.\r\n\r\nThis is in addition to the bug with HS mentioned an hour ago.\r\n\r\n(And now I will press \"Add Comment\" once and only once...)",
