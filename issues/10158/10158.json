    "Description": "When I use the 'copy character stats to clipboard', spell cycles and sequence are not included. It would be very useful to have this information if possible.\nÂ \nFurthermore, I'd like to request that total mana cost and total damage dealt by each spell cycle be included in the data. I can see Dps/Mps/Tps of individual spells/rotations when I mouseover those in the stats, but it would be nice to see the changes in damage and mana consumption those spells have when combining with abilities, trinket and consumables.",
