    "Description": "I have Totem of Calming Tides, but rawr doesn't know the proc affect, so it's a 0 rating overall...I'm trying to edit it myself to add the aura affect that occurs, but under \"Add Special Effect\" there is no trigger for Chain Heal Cast.  I was wondering if maybe you could add this into your resto modification just as a touchup to assist with the resto shaman portion of Rawr?  Let me know if you need anything else that's not listed below.  Thanks.\nÂ \nTotem of Calming Tides:\nEffect: Each time you cast Chain Heal, you have a chance to gain 234 spell power for 15 sec.\nTrigger: Chain Heal Cast\nDuration: 15 sec\nInternal CD: 0\nProc Chance: 70%\nDoes not stack\nName of Buff: Spiritual Chance",
