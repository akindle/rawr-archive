    "Description": "Finally had the time to sit down and run upgrade lists for my cat/bear druid, but when I glanced at the bear upgrade list before saving it, the results seemed very... strange. My bear gear currently is Conqueror's Nightsong Raiments; however, according to Rawr my best upgrade in the game is the physical DPS heirloom chest. The SECOND best upgrade is the CASTER leather heirloom chest. This is even after updating each item's stats, which are pretty scanty.",
