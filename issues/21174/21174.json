TW support should be added with next version of Rawr, CN depending on whether Blizzard adds support for it by that time.\r\n\r\nIf you could post an example character realm/name that would be helpful so we can test if there are any issues.",

Because I have used a modified version of Rawr which can load from CN battle.net when we were stiil in WLK.....\r\nHere is an example(we have been in CTM 4.1 for 3 weeks ,but it seems that the CN armory didn't update yet.....maybe it will update to CTM soon.. ) \r\nrealm:瑞文戴尔\r\nCharacterName:恶灵召唤\r\nwebsite:http://cn.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=%E7%91%9E%E6%96%87%E6%88%B4%E5%B0%94&cn=%E6%81%B6%E7%81%B5%E5%8F%AC%E5%94%A4\r\n\r\nBy the way, How can i translate the Rawr in Chinese?Especially for Gears Database..... did you supply a way for us to do it? It's OK for me to use English Rawr but not for others Chinese fans.... I think you can use lua include in your Rawr, So we can just modifier lua text file to translate it\r\n",

There's no Chinese version of wowhead so that way it's not possible at the moment. After Blizzard API includes items it might be possible to get translations from there.",
