    "Description": "I have been wondering this for a while, but has anyone thought about having the ability to import pet info from the Armory. The XML file specifically states what type pet it is, whether it's a Tenacity, Cunning, or Furocity pet, and the key value. As an example, I'm going to post the XML tags from a guildy's pet\n \n<pet catId=\"23\" family=\"Wolf\" familyId=\"1\" icon=\"ability_hunter_pet_wolf\" lvl=\"80\" name=\"Wolfimus\" npcId=\"30455\" npcName=\"Frostworg\">\n        <talentGroup active=\"1\" group=\"1\" icon=\"ability_druid_swipe\" key=\"Ferocity\" order=\"0\" prim=\"Ferocity\">\n          <talentSpec treeOne=\"16\" treeThree=\"0\" treeTwo=\"0\" value=\"201000230300013000100\"/>\n        </talentGroup>\n      </pet>\n \nI understand that hunters can have up to 5 pets, so adding a drop down somewhere on selecting a pet to use could be useful.",
