    "Description": "in response to Levva's reaction on my post on mmo-champions rawr related forum topic, I'd like to submit the following issue;\n \nwhen I input my enhancement shaman's gear, and rotation into\nRawr.enhance 2.3.5, I get\n8781.75 dps, with glyph of lightning shield, FS excluded from rotation. \n8723.98 dps, with glyph of lightning shield, FS included in the rotation.\n8752.45 dps, with glyph of flame shock, FS included in rotation.\n \nI did not expect those results, since it's commonly accepted since wow patch 3.3, that using flame shock in the enhancement priority rotation, is an improvement of dps.\n \nwhen I export my rawr information to enhsim, version 1.9.5.4, I get:\n8156.1 dps, with glyph of lightning shield, and FS excluded from rotation.\n8201.13 dps, with glyph of lightning shield, and FS INcluded in the rotation.\n8290.76 dps, with glyph of flame shock, and FS included in the rotation\n \nwhich does display the normal/expected behaviour, of FS adding tot total damage. however, the difference in dps between both programs is quite large.\n \nboth XML's have been saved with +glyph of FS, and +FS in rotation",

There was a big bug in EnhSim that overestimated the effects of FS glyph to the point where now the accepted wisdom is that it is not good for us.\r\n\r\nV1.9.8.10 has the fix.\r\n\r\nFixed how the Glyph of Flame Shock was being applied for Work Item # 6927.\r\nEnded up that the glyph was having too large of an impact on Flame Shock's damage.\r\nIt should now be more closely align to how the damage is on Live.
