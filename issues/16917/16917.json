    "Description": "When I open rawr, the start page display is off (imagine putting a picture that's too small to take up your whole desktop background, so it keeps looping over and over. A bunch of mini pictures next to one another instead of one big one. It's like that). Also, the names of items overlap one another under comparisons on the right, and the item slots on the left aren't all the same. Lastly, when I try to load from the armory, I get an error saying that the armory sent a message back, and it just stays there; nothing happens afterwards. Any way to fix these things?",
