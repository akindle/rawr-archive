    "Description": "Upgraded to 2.3.17, loaded my warrior from the armory and was surprised to see the Tier10 (amongst other things) missing from certain gear slots. Searching the issues I saw the comment about adjusting my filters. Which I did, but still the the Tier10 items are missing. \n \nThe example I present is for the head slot on a protection warrior. \n \nI assume the Sanctified [Ymirjar Lord's Greathelm] should be considered an upgrade to the [Headplate of the Honorbound]. \n \nWowhead isn't the end all of gear comparisons but here is a link comparing the 2 items: http://www.wowhead.com/compare?items=51218;47678\nThe [Ymirjar Lord's Greathelm] looks like a upgrade to me!\n \n \nAttached is a screenshot of my filters, Head slot, Sorted: Overall.\n \n I assume the [Ymirjar Lord's Greathelm] are in the Tier10 Raids (10/25) ICC area.  Maybe they are in another area?\n \nThanks for your time.",

I searched for \"missing upgrades\", \"missing equipment\", \"bad filters\" and did not get any hits in the issue tracker that I thought was related to my problem. I searched the FAQ for an answer and did not find it. *If* it has indeed been answered \"many\" times isn't that the definition of FAQ?  Instead of a terse \"... you are an idiot! RTFM! ...\" response, why not link the Issue Tracker, Discussion threads, and FAQ URLs in your comment?\r\n\r\n",
