    "Description": "Howdy.\n \nI'm wondering why my Rawr is suggesting wrong enchants? I am an arcanemage and here are the surprising results:\n \nHead: 10mp5 30spellpower (56,83) >> 20crit 30spellpower (42,77)\n(mp5 over the crit huh?)\n \nShoulders: 10crit 18spellpower (41,69) >> 15crit 24spellpower (27,19)\n(this could never be true)\n \nCloak: 15haste (28,92) >> 27spellpower (17,14)\n(I highly doubt this as well)\n \nChest: +10stats (-8.39) >> +8stats (18,26)\n(yes the +10stats gives a minusvalue...)\n \nWrists: +23spellpower (40,26) >> +30spellpower (22,39)\n(...)\n \nLegs: +50spellpower +30sta (87,30) >> +50spellpower +20spirit (79,02)\n(Also Sanctified and Brilliant spellthreads are both +50sd +20spi, other one shows 109,14)\n \nFeet: +18spirit (19,22) >> Nitro boosts +24 Crit (-5,51)\n(minusvalue again d'oh)\n \nMain Hand: +50spellpower (80,16) >> +63spellpower (87,53)\n(...)\n \n \nI'm very confused. All I do is load my character from armory and then start browsing those Comparisons -> Enchants.\nIf this is very rare case and happens only on my char, then feel free to try it out.\nIf I'm nubbering and doing something very wrong, then feel free to correct me. Thanks.\n \nRuntu @ Arathor-EU",
