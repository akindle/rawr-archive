I also confirmed it would crash if you loaded a Mage then tried to load a Bear. So its something to do with the transition to a bear when bear isn't the default.",

      "Message": "Further update the issue is that Rawr.Bear CalculationsBear.cs line 1422 has \r\n\r\ncharacter.ActiveBuffs.Add(Buff.GetBuffByName(\"Bloodlust\"));\r\n\r\nwhich means that a null gets added to Activebuffs as no such buff exists. This is a potentially wider issue as the protection level on Character.ActiveBuffs at present is such that its easy to add nulls to it and cause issues. Perhaps as an interim measure Buff.GetBuffByName should throw a warning if it is about to return a null so that the error can be trapped at source.",
