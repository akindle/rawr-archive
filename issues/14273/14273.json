    "Description": "First of all I wanted to know if it is normal that Threat is rated so high, especially on main hand weapons? Because of that, all those damage dealer weapons like Hellscream Slice or Blackhorn Bludgeon are shown on top of my list (see the attachment)...\nÂ \nSecondly, many of the trinkets lost their special stats recently, like the Black Heart or Essence of Gossamer. No matter how often I update my item cache from both sources (Armory or WoWHead), the special affects don't come back and the items are rated accordingly low im comparison to others. I know I could add the effects manually, but I don't wanna do that all the time, so I asked myself what could be the reason behind loosing those stats from time to time.",

      "Message": "The problem had a couple sources:\r\n1) Relevancy for each type of thing (Buff, Item, Enchant, etc.) was being separately handled and updating each thing to all triggers, stats, etc. wasn't lining up correctly. Probably would have been fine if we had an actual ProtPaladin dev but with each of us other devs (and community members) pitching in to take care of the model until I'm not surprised this became an issue. I'm committing a change to the module to push all the relevancy stuff to use a single function (except where necessary to turn certain things on/off).\r\n2) Essence of Gossamer didn't have an equip line processor to model it's effect. Unfortunately, we don't have a variable in place for Damage absorb, so in it's place (until we get that in there) I've added -1% Damage Taken instead, which is a reasonable approximation.\r\n\r\nIf you will attach your character file to this issue, I can look more into the offensive weapons showing higher value. As a side-note, please note that you can change the threat scaling on the options pane, which may help your immediate issue.",

      "Message": "This is normal for weapons.\r\n\r\nBecause of the way Threat Points are calculated, and the fact that Hammer of the Righteous requires a weapon, weapons provide more threat than any other piece of gear, so naturally it would be in the 1000's of TPS / 10,000's of Threat Points.\r\n\r\nThe most I can suggest is changing the threat point ratio down to like.. 30% of normal, when you want to do a good comparison of mitigation/survival weapons vs dps weapons.\r\n\r\nWhen Negarine and I spent time looking at the way our points were calculated, we decided to agree on 1 tps = 10 threat points, just to keep some sort of logic and a basis of comparison alongside mitigation and survival scores.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, other than that sort of at-a-glance factor, I would not suggest even having *any* threat score display in the comparison window when making item comparisons or building/optimizing a gear set.",

Couldn't think of it myself...\r\n\r\nAny ideas why the special effects on some trinkets don't come back, no mether how often I update my item cache or the items themself?\r\n\r\nPS: I attached the character file to this post.",

This was fixed recently, so expect to see this trinket working correctly for 2.2.20.",
