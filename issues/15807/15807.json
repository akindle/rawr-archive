    "Description": "i think it would be nice if there was an option in rawr to set a minimum of amount of set items(of a specific set) that the optimizer should use when composing your optimal item set.\n \nthe idea is basicly the same as when you set a minimum for resistance or life or spell power, just for set items.\n \nit could be a warrior wanting to use 2 set pieces bonus of T9 for his PvP set. (im no warrior expert) but this specific bonus is not unique since the extra crit or ArP can be optained in other ways, but alot of other bonuses cannot be optained since this arent just flat stat bonuses.\n \n \n \nkind regards\n \nPeter",
