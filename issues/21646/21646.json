    "Description": "NOTE:  Moved here on Pericles' request from http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/rawr-official/tickets/34-option-to-turn-off-tooltip-details-ignore-survivability/\n \n-----\n \nI would love some extra configuration options, specifically the ability to hide some tooltip lines [in the in-game addon], and the option to exclude the survivability score from the overall (upgrade) score [in the in-game addon]:\n \nSimplistic example options window:\n \n    Data source [show/hide] (i.e. the \"Rawr: Battle.net/Loaded from Addon\" line)\n    Overall score [show/hide]\n    DPS score [show/hide]\n    Survivability score [show/hide]\n        Include survivability in overall score? [yes/no] \n    Drop location [show/hide] \n \nFor example, when I'm playing my mage, I just want to see the DPS score, and I don't want the survivability score to influence anything.\n \n-----\n \nPericles:\n \n    All good suggestions. However what is actually happening is that this data is loaded from Rawr itself. The options need to be included in Rawr rather than the addon. Can you repost these suggestions on the Rawr Issue tracker and they can be incorporated into the main application.\n \n    I'd suggest the idea would be you could have additional options boxes on an Addon options tab, then the export would just ignore data you said to hide. This would also mean the time to generate the export would be faster and the time to import to the addon would be quicker if there is less data to generate and import.",
