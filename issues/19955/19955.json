    "Description": "My PC at home is pretty good and it finishes an optimise within about 20 secs or less.   Normally this of course would be fantastic, but I am finding at the moment that if I run the optimiser 3-4 times, i'll get different combinations of reforges that give slightly higher or lower scores.   The differences are small (like swapping reforges to get exactly on the hit cap instead of one over the cap) and are all in about +/- 1 dps so it isn't a major thing.   It does bother me a little when the optimiser recommends a downgrade to my gear.\n \nI am optimising with the condition to not have my interrupts miss.\n \nIf the optimiser had increased thoroughness, it might be able to successfully examine all the different reforging combinations and consistantly come up with the best solution.\n \nThe attached caharacter file has been optimised once - and got an overall score of 20037.95.\nSuccessive optimises got :-   (1) 20040.44   (2) 20042.1  (3) 20042.1 (different reforges though)  (4) 20041.27",
