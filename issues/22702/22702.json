    "Description": "I'm very impressed with the changes to [ProtPaladin] since Kavan too over, but I find the dodge/parity tradeoff confusing.\nÂ \nPlease look at the attached xml file.  If I unreforge my neck, then my Avoidance goes up and my Total Mitigation stays the same, but my Mitigation score at the bottom of the page goes down.  This would make sense if Rawr somehow knew that I was going to put Windwalker on my weapon or if it took into account the my trinket's on-use effect.  But in this xml file my weapon is unenchanted, and I chose the Option to ignore on-use effects.",
