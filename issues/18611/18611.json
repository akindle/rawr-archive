    "Description": "I understand that latency can and will have an impact on both rotations and overall DPS. However the top three glyphs for hunters changes drastically with each 50ms interval change. It may be that it has always been this way but recently noticed changed presets of latency from 0ms to 150ms. Not real sure if these recommendations for glyphing are correct or if the calculations behind them are off somehow. Personally I've seen my latency fluctuate during a single fight from less than 100ms to over 250ms. With certain casting bar addons, I can compensate for the latency but I'm sure that it never perfect. Most noticeable changes are Aimed Shot and Chimera Shot Glyphs. For example, with Chimera, Serpent and Steady Glyphs selected and 0ms Latency, Aimed shows as ~14DPS yet at 50ms it shows ~240DPS. Selecting only 2 Glyphs and trying to identify which would be the best third glyph changes at different setting with Chimera going from best or next best to having negative values.",
