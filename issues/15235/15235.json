    "Description": "Just worried about the new calculations, Optimize with Talents, Regem and Enchants suggest removing Expose Weakness completely. This gives me 650AP bonus most of the time.\nAlso I may have reached a Crit Cap, that was not noticed in 2.27, now suggests using a haste scope on my ranged weapon, and some haste gems.\nAlso Blood Fury is no longer in Shot Rotation anymore.",
