    "Description": "I have tried using Rawr on several occasions in the past two weeks.  On only one occasion, I was able to load my character correctly, displaying all of the Basic Stats as well as the Simulation and Spells panes fully.  On every other occasion, these panes are not displaying any information.  \nÂ \nI realize these are listed as flaky, but I was unable to get the information to display when inputting information manually as well.  I have attached a character generated from the Rawr add-on.  My apologies if I'm doing it wrong, but I read over the Help sections and reached the same conclusion each time.",
