    "Description": "Is it possible to add a setting for the amount of milliseconds that the rotation waits for higher prio shots.\nÂ \nThere is a CDCutoff variable at the basic options tab... but I think that is for how long the readiness should wait for Rapid fire, or? (expressed in seconds)",

      "Message": "The CDCutoff variable is only used for Readiness. At present there is no variable that you can state to hold off firing a shot and wait for another one, however I don't think there's a need for one. The rotation setup (in it's current state) automatically does checks to see if your higher prio shot will be coming up soon enough that you should wait, whatever the exact timing is. Adding a control for that yourself would probably only serve to do more harm than good. Besides, this rotation setup (I hope) won't exist anymore soon in favor of an actual model (which will make Astry very happy).",
