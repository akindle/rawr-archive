    "ClosedComment": "Closing this issue.Actually getting to the crit cap for ret is unlikely seeing we&#39;re a 2H class and thus the chance to reach as high with real gear is unlikely.Not going to bother with just trying to fix this specicifally. However, it is on the table for review with reworking the melee attack code &#40;which has some weird issues atm&#41;.",

    "Description": "One day, I was just curious what if a ret plaladin's critical percentage increased over 71.2% (which comes from Crit cap formula)\n \nSo, I modified an item 4101 of critical(over 100%) , 300 expertise, 3000 strength, 0 hit raiting and eqquiped just that one. \nbut the RAWR showed the critical percentage on white damage as 92% and 8% of miss. \nBased on a crit cap fomula, 'Crit Cap = 100 - Glancing - Boss Crit to Hit Conversion - Dodge - Miss', it should been shown as 8% miss, 4.8% hit, 63.2% critical 24% glancing. (I think). \nI tried same thing on DPSwarrior module, and it said 8% miss, 4.8% hit, 63.2% critical and 24% glancing. \n \nI aware the RAWR decreses a 4.8 percentage of critical strike, so that the differenc of critical percentage occurs between the rawr stats and the wowarmory stats. \n \nMaybe 4.8 did not applied on actual calculation on Ret-Paladin module.\n \nattacing some screenshots of the experimental. \n \nThanks for the great program.",
