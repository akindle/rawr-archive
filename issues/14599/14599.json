    "ClosedComment": "Take the Fight Duration and reduce it below 300 &#40;E.g.- 299&#41; Then you will see value to Rapid Killing. This also works at any point where an additional Rapid Fire could occur &#40;multiples of 240-1 and&#47;or 300-1 in fight duration&#41;.Root cause for not seeing constant value is that it doesn&#39;t take in partial activates to smooth it over. This would require a major rewrite to the activates system in Hunter",
