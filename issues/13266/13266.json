    "Description": "Lately some people including myself has had a problem with using the normal Taiwan Armory site. This also means I can't load from Armory within Rawr. Someone suggested using \"http://armory.wowtaiwan.com.tw\" instead of the old \"http://tw.wowarmory.com\".\nThe new link works so far on my browser. But I haven't found a way to change the address with Rawr.\nCould you please somehow add \"http://armory.wowtaiwan.com.tw\" to the Taiwan Armory address?",
