    "Description": "Some calculations in the moonkin model require that \"Moonkin Form\" and/or \"Improved Moonkin Form\" is selected on the buffs page and others only require that the talent is selected on the Talents pages.  \n \nTo be able to get proper information when out of form and to be consistent, I'd recommend at a minimum the following changes:\n \n            Stats statsFuror = new Stats()\n            {\n                BonusIntellectMultiplier = 0.02f * character.DruidTalents.Furor\n            }\n \nto:\n \n            Stats statsFuror = new Stats()\n            {\n                BonusIntellectMultiplier = character.ActiveBuffsContains(\"Moonkin Form\") ?\n                                            0.02f * character.DruidTalents.Furor : 0.0f\n            };\nwith similar changes in all other places that consider only the talent.  A preferred solution would be to add an \"Caster Form/Moonkin Form\" option to the \"Character Definition\" section of the stats page if that's possible or to the options page if not that would automatically set/clear the moonkin form and improved moonkin form options on the buff page.\n \nAs for why the out of form information is useful -- when the in form fully equipped and buffed stats don't match the in-game info, it's useful to be able to remove gear/talents/buffs to find the cause of the mismatch.",
