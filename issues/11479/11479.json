I downloaded the latest source code and did a bit of searching and found that the Avatar buff does seem to exist in code (Buff.cs, lines 1981 - 1993), but simply isn't appearing in the interface.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Rawr doesn't know that \"Cowl of the Avatar\" and \"Mantle of the Avatar\" are part of that set?  Or perhaps there is a limit in the interface to only show nine Set Bonuses?\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks much!",

Since it is listed last in the code.  However, would it be possible the bonus isn't being calculated at all?  A quick test would be to delete the mooncloth or Gladiator gear bonuses and recompile to see if it will display.  Pic attached.\r\n\r\nThanks",
