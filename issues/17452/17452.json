    "Description": "I know this has been brought up before in various issues but I figure i'll mention it again.     Every version that comes out, I have to spend a lot of time updating data.  \n \nThis last release, most of the tier 10 gear had a location of \"sold by     at   \" and did not appear in the regular filters.   The only way I could even find them was to make my own \"all items\" filter and then refresh the items.    I have had to do this for 4-5 toons on a couple of PC's so far and may yet have to for my other alts.  I assume that I am not the only one that has run into this problem as I have had the problem on two separate PC's.    Most of us experienced users just deal with these things as they occur but it would be difficult for new users to even find the items to refresh them.\n \nWould it be possible to have a full refresh from armory for each version or something?    I know this is extremely time consuming and may not be feasible.    Are there any other options to help improve this?",

There is indeed a full refresh that happens each time a release goes out, from Wowhead, since it's generally more reliable.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the item cache is a full-time job, figuratively speaking. We do what we can, and would definitely welcome anyone taking on that role.",
