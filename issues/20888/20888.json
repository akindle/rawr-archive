    "Description": "Minor Issue: When I optimize (for mage at least) the ring slots aren't interchangeable. e.g. If the 2nd slot ring is identical to the 1st slot of the base spec, the optimized spec does not consider it the same. In the game stats they produce identical results.\nÂ \nI suppose it may be the same with trinkets.",
