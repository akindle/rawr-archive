    "Description": "Using Rawr 2.3.11, the Direct Upgrades and Direct Upgrades/Cost lists for the ProtWarr model display all tank items without any sort of values assigned to them, giving you what is essentially a blank listed sorted in alphabetical order. Running a Build Upgrade List does generate a working Upgrade List, but it doesn't carry over into the Direct Upgrade lists. It does work as expected in the Tree and Moonkin models.",
