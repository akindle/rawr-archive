    "Description": "When I loaded the attached xml file and hit optimize, it said that using Enlightenment and Flame Leviathan Fueling Manual was part of the optimum gear combination.  I double-checked, and it knows that Enlightenment is a two-handed item.  It should never allow an off-hand and a two-handed weapon to be equipped at the same time.",
