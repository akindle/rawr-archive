    "Description": "Not a bug per se, but two suggestions:\n1. Opening the edit items takes ages because rawr reads all the items, either make it show no items on load or load the class specific/usable items.\n2. Searching for an item is slow because every time you type a letter it starts to search so if you're typing the item name it gets stuck on the first letter, my suggestion is not to start searching untill a second (or more or less) has past from the time the user entered a letter in the search box, which would make searching for known items alot faster.",
