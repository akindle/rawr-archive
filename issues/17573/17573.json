      "Message": "Same problem here. I don't want rawr to optimize the gemming, so i made one custom template and disabled all the others. I also disabled all gems not in my template in slot:gems.\r\nNow with \"Consider gems in enabled gemming templates to be available\" enabled (default) the optimizer still uses all gems, like choosing hit gems when I'm below the cap that I made unavailable.\r\nWith this option disabled it only considers the gems I choosed, but keeps putting them into other sockets than specified by the template, e.g. red gems into blue sockets.\r\n",

But I still think that a custom template would be the better way to do so, e.g. I don't have to regem new items manually or if I respec (as a mage from arcane to fire) and value\r\ncrit gems higher than haste then I only have to change one template and not all of my items in rawr.",
