This is the \"permanent fix\" for frost emblem items not showing up in 2.3.10, and it probably works with your 2.3.9 ItemSource.xml because that file was updated through the armoury.\r\n\r\nBut if you are using the cost prtion of optimize then you are correct. For example if i load frost costs and tell optimizer i want to spend less than 30 emblems, then i expect it to show no new gear since everything costs more than 30 emblems.\r\n",
