    "Description": "Right now in the Edit Item section, there are SIX versions of \"Spell Power (10 Sec)\" I right now can only figure out the second one works on items with a 15% chance to proc, and the 5th one is for items that have a 10% chance to proc. Is there any way to clear up that list to help with theorycrafting new items; Such as the Eye of the Broodmother (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?item=45308)",

      "Message": "This comment, for whatever reason, was actually originally posted by me on EJ forums. I'm not sure why someone else added it here as an issue. Importing trinkets works fine, save for the fact that some on use trinkets or effect trinkets are not properly imported. Instead of listing a 432 haste for 20 second on use proc, for instance, it averages it out to 72 haste (Scale of Fates).\r\n\r\nHilariously, I actually made a mistake in my comment on EJ when I said there are six Spell Power procs. The sixth one I was referring to is actually Spell Power increased on resists (Eye of Magtheridon), so really there's only five, but, like I said, this comment was practically taken word for word, if not copy/pasted.\r\n\r\nThe gemming template was a great feature, and really cleaned things up. It'll be nice to see how this proc/use system turns out.",
