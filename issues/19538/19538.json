    "Description": "Loaded my Paladin from Battle.net. Loads fine, but I get an error with no information. Close Error and all available items listed are leather. I try to adjust the item filter but the only item filter options available appear to be for a druid. I cannot choose any other item types, such as cloth, mail, plate, or weapons such as 2h axes and swords. Staves are available but useless for a paladin. Shields are not available either. I'm not sure what files to attach to this as I didn't recieve any info on the error message, and I don't believe this is specific to my character.",

      "Message": "About 2 weeks ago I was unable to load my paladin. This is a given as paladin hasn't been set up yet, but I was able to list plate in the filters at the time, in the list on the right for potential upgrades etc. Now, I can load my paladin with the correct talent trees, but can't get any plate items to appear in the right window area. Previously I could manually input my paladin and whatever gear wasn't already listed in onboard cache, now none of the plate, mail, or cloth will list at all, even on a blank character.",
