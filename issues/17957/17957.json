      "Message": "A) We've made it as easy as possible to build an upgrade list, and save that upgrade list, so that you can *very* quickly open it again in the future, and/or just leave it open to check when something drops. At the cost of just a little alt-tabbing, you get fully accurate upgrade valuation.\r\n\r\nB) If you *really* can't be bothered to alt-tab, and *really* don't care about accuracy (no, really, I'm serious. Stat weights are downright wrong, very frequently. Don't underestimate how wrong they are. If you even remotely care about your performance (and I assume you do, since you're using Rawr), you *really* shouldn't use stat weights), Rawr already does support exporting to Pawn. Just goto the Relative Stat Values chart, *THOROUGHLY READ THE BIG RED WARNING*, then read it again, make sure you understand it, read it again one more time for good measure, then click Export in the top right.",
