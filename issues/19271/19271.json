    "Description": "Whenever I try to go to the Rawr page on EJ using Firefox, I get the following error:\n---------------------\nError Deserializing the Item Cache\nFunction:ItemCache.Load(...)\nError Message: There is an error in XML document (9195, 12).\nInner Error Message: Instance validation error: 'ShieldofRighteousness' is not a valid value for Trigger.\nInfo: No Additional Info\nStack Trace:\n  at System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize(XmlReader xmlreader, String encodingStyle, Object events)\n  at System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize(TextReader textreader)\n  at Rawr.ItemCacheInstance.Load(TextReader textreader)\n---------------------\nWhen this error pops up, Firefox isn't necessarily locking up, but it won't let me click on the \"OK\" in the error window, and I can't do anything else with Firefox while the error window is still up, so I have to close Firefox from the task manager. I can load it fine in IE, but ew, gross, IE.\n \nVitals: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10\nAdblock/Noscript are installed, but I disabled them while trying to diagnose the problem with no improvement.\n \nI realize it's a couple versions out of date (currently on 3.6.13).... I apparently stopped an update download without realizing it and have since resumed it. But it's really not that far behind that it should be catastrophically failing like this, and I don't know whether you guys are really the LATEST BROWSER OR GTFO crowd or the kind of people who realize people use different versions of different browsers all the time.",
