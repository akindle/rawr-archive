    "Description": "Hello,\n \nLet me say that rawr3 looks so much cooler than rawr2 and thanks for developing it.\n \nHow ever i could not find any explanation or solution to see recommended upgrades for my gear.\nThe item filter is simply empty and no items are offered me only show my current item.\n \nAlso i try to add custom item filter, but no items anyway.\n \nI have latest build of rawr3 b3.0.3.21\n \nIs it supposed to be like that or i miss something ? In rawr2 as you load up your character you can see all items for upgrade, but here i simply have nothing.\n \nThanks.",
