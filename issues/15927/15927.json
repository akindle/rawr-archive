    "Description": "I am using source code build: 45485.\nThe proc for this is 678 armor pen.  Refreshing from wow armory, and in game tooltip all confirm.\nI am at 48.44% armor pen (678 rating, without ArP gems).  Softcap being 722 for this item.\nI run an optimize with this item selected (without ArP gems selected), optimize finishes, changes the proc to 540.57 armor pen, reducing its value.\nÂ \nIt is as if it averages out the proc, adds it to my ArP rating, then uses that new value to see if i am over softcap, then claims I am wasting ArP rating.",

      "Message": "I have figured out the problem.  In one of my slots I have a piece of gear checked that has armor pen, but my better piece has none.  In the optimize it considers that piece of gear, which puts me over softcap, and lowers the trinket.  However, when it determines this, and switches back to my main piece, the trinket armor pen change remains.  I assume this is because the modification of the actual item in the item cache, instead of a temporary item w/ adjusted armor pen.  So the problem really is that you cant optimize multiple pieces of gear correctly with the trinket if any combination will bring you over softcap because of the way it modifies the trinket in its testing/analysis.",

I have made some changes to the code that will prevent that from ever happening again and some new optimizes now place you within earshot of the ArP softcap and Needle equipped to it's full effect.\r\n\r\nThe next version will no longer have this issue, until then the only option for you to have a working file is to compile the latest SVN.",
