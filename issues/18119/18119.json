    "Description": "I notice that the ArP value in Rawr is different from reality .... well All the maths that it makes to give the best conjunction of gear and gems is based in a wrong value of ArP, as an example i have 1338 ArP, but in Rawr it says i have 1437 and makes all the maths as i was already capped in ArP",
