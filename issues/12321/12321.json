    "Description": "Steps to repeat:\nOpen rawr (open a file or not, works either way)\nChoose druid/bear\ntool-> default gems\nAdd this gem set\n24sta 24sta 24sta 32sta2armor\nAdd this gem set\n8dodge12sta 8def12sta 24sta 32sta2armor\nclick delete non-listed\nclick ok\nSwitch to cat model (so that the list re-sorts, making it easier to select)\ntool-> default gems \n(the list is now prepopulated which is new in this edition from 2.1.4 though this bug happened in 2.1.4 as well)\nAdd this gem set:\n16str 16str 16str 21agi3crit\nAdd next\n16str 16ap8hit 16ap12sta 21agi3crit\nAdd next\n16str 8haste8str 16ap12sta 21agi3crit\nclick delete non-listed\nclick ok\n \nSomething strange happens how.  You will see that last line deleted just before the stuff is refreshed.  \n \nIf you go to your hats and sort alphabetical you will see that there are only 4 gemmings being done.\n \nThe set default gems tab is now completely hosed and keeps behaving really strange no matter what you do at this point.  Try a few things you will see.  Weird stuff happens.\n \nClosing and reopening Rawr clears the strange behavior until the next time you try to put in 5 or more gemmings at one time.\n \nThis probably works with any gemmings you select not specificly the ones I have above but I figured for completeness I would list them.\n \nWorkaround: Put in a couple gemmings clicking delete non-listed.  Close Rawr.  Reopen.  Put in more not clicking delete non-listed.",
