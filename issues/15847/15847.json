    "Description": "One thing that I have used a lot with Rawr2 is the ability to see how buffs/talents/options change my DPS.  In Rawr2, the Overall DPS was shown as a status bar at the bottom of the window, regardless of what screen I was on.  In Rawr3, the only way to view DPS is to go to the Stats tab and scroll down to where it's displayed (in DPSWarr, it's near the bottom).  It would be nice if the Overall Score was visible somewhere outside of the tabs, so it could be viewed from anywhere.",
