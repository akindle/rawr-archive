    "Description": "I think this may be something Blizzard are doing not you guys, but since both armory and in-game differ from Rawr I thought I'd mention it.\n \nSpirit is much higher in-game than in Rawr, in my current gear I have 206 points more spirit and accordingly a lot more hit. I've done manual calculations on the spirit from all my items and get 1070 (stats, gems, chants, reforging) yet in the armory and\n in-game I see 1276 +175 base = 1451. In Rawr I'm just seeing 1245 (1070+175). No idea where the extra 206 points of bonus spirit is coming from. I can't see talents for it, and it's not food or buffs. Any ideas why there is a difference?\n \nhttp://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/nagrand/carnacki/simple\n \nI'm pretty sure the in-game figures are right because I tried casting with 17% hit (mainly from spirit) and was getting zero misses. If the game is right (and I'd assume it is) then I guess Rawr needs changing to match.",

      "Message": "I found this (closed) issue http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/19547 while searching for something else. Guessing its the same problem - but there's no explanation of why its not an issue. Its just closed.\r\n\r\nHave changed gear since I reported the issue and the discrepancy is gone now. In-game and armory report 175+1044 = 1219, Rawr reports 1219 as well. I think the problem is/was linked to my trousers - darkbrand leggings of the undertow from memory. When I changed them out the spirit discrepancy disappeared. The leggings had no spirit on them, but that's what I changed to get rid of the difference.\r\n",

      "Message": "The other issue that you referenced had absolutely no detail in it, so I was unable to determine what the actual problem was.  I closed it simply thinking that they were referencing the Moonkin's base spirit, which doesn't apply to Balance of Power.  As for this, I'm closing it because items with random stats are already a known issue.",

      "Message": "Ahh, ok thanks for that. I'd swear the leggings weren't showing up with spirit in the WoW UI or on Armory because I double checked every item trying to calculate the total spirit of my gear. Sadly I vendored them when I got an upgrade so I can't double check. Sorry for wasting your time.",
