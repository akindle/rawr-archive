I was on my way in for another stab at it to copy the error text, but now Rawr will not get past the splash screen before going unresponsive. I'm deleting and reinstalling Rawr... soon as I get that done I'll edit in the error text unless someone else beats me to it.",

Open, select file, save talent build, open new without saving old (the talent build still saves).\r\n\r\n************** Exception Text **************\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: <CalculationOptionsPriest xmlns=''> was not expected.\r\n   at Microsoft.Xml.Serialization.GeneratedAssembly.XmlSerializationReaderCalculationOptionsHolyPriest.Read4_CalculationOptionsHolyPriest()\r\n\r\n\r\n************** Loaded Assemblies **************\r\nmscorlib\r\n    Assembly Version: 2.0.0.0\r\n    Win32 Version: 2.0.50727.3082 (QFE.050727-3000)\r\n    CodeBase: file:///c:/WINDOWS/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v2.0.50727/mscorlib.dll\r\n----------------------------------------",
