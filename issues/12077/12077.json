    "Description": "I've been noticing that the optimizer often fails to find the equal of or even improve upon some solutions that I've hand generated.\nPlease consider the following suggestions to improve the results of the optimizer (in increasing complexity / implementation cost)\nÂ \n1. Start the optimization assuming the current set of gear so that it never \"backslides\" in finding better solutions.\n2. Optimize gear for Armor Sets first since the 4 piece bonuses are usually amazingly good -- then remove ONE of the 5 items.\n3. Convert the optimizer to a more complex linear programming solver -- something like a Simulated Annealing algorithm.",
