    "Description": "I'm building up my sets for my leatherworking druid, and I noticed that for some reason Icescale Leg Armor is showing a much higher DPS rating (83.92 in my current optimization) than Nerubian Leg Reinforcements (57.86). However, both of these items have exactly the same stats, 75 ap and 22 crit, the only difference being that the Nerubian is a self-only enhancement. This is in v2.2.2, building a cat-model druid.",

      "Message": "I took Icescale and the other LW pattern like it, Frosthide Leg Armor, off my enchants list and ran another optimization. I noticed that it was suggesting a switch to no offhand - for some reason the first optimization had put an offhand in with my 2H staff.  Icescale and Nerubian changed to equal values (57.86).\r\n\r\nI re-allowed Icescale and Frosthide and ran it again. The armor values came up correctly, but again the optimizer has me equipping an offhand with my 2H staff.",
