    "Description": "For some reason Item 56464 & 63476 can't be seen in the Gear>Wrist list in Rawr. They are both found in the item database in options>edit items and I can't see anything wrong with my filters or the settings in the edit items section...they just don't appear!\n \nTested with 4.0.20.0b downloaded, via browser and downloaded version.\n \nAlso I see you cant load items from wowhead any more like you use to be able to. (Import>Load Items from Wowhead NIY?) any timescale for this feature to be re-introduced?\n \nApologies if this has been asked before, I have spent 20 mins searching to find the answer and couldn't.\n \nThanks for the great program! Puts me miles ahead compared to my fellow guildies! (Silly maxdps users!)\n \nAttached Character XML for my Holydin!\n \nCheers for any help.",

Cant believe I missed that spirit option!\r\n\r\nI think you miss-understood one of my questions though. When is the feature to download all items from Wowhead going to be released again? (e.g the whole database, not just specifics).",
