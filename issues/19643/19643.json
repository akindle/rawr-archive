    "Description": "There is a duplicate of the Elixir of Deep Earth mixology instead of Master mixology, at least under Bear (not sure if these are shared or not).\n \nAlso per prior conversation I totally get a higher rating with two elixirs than the flask even without master mixology.  So I'm very glad this was added.  Now I know for sure to switch.  \n \nThough honestly AGI scroll plus deep earth may be better but scrolls are also still bugged (see re-opened other ticket).\n \nSome of the old elixirs that have obviously upgraded versions can probably be removed (i.e. elixir of accuracy) to shorten/clean up the list a bit.  It's rather long.",
