I updated the item cache from the Armory, and the correct stats are still not shown in Rawr.\n \nTimeless Dark Jade:\nhttp://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=39968\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?item=39968\n \nPerfect Timeless Dark Jade:\nhttp://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=41479\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?item=41479\n \nTimeless Forest Emerald:\nhttp://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=40085\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?item=40085\n \nTimeless Eye of Zul:\nhttp://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=40164\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?item=40164",

People do have reasons for using gems with stats that Rawr might not consider relevant.",
