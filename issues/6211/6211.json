      "Message": "Added an extended tool tip check box and used those on the buff selection form.  \r\nAdded a Description property to the Buff class and typed a few out.  You'll have to delete your buff cache (or we make the field non optional and that should throw an error on deserialization of the current file) for the descriptions to show up.\r\n\r\nMany buffs still need descriptions.",

      "Message": "Yea, I see how that tool tip was generated with the existing buff data, shouldn't be a problem to use it instead of a description field on the buff.  I was thinking that we wanted the text from the spell itself for display, not just the stat.  Not really sure how I got that in my head.\r\n\r\n",
