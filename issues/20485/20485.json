    "Description": "Rawr thinks that Symbiotic Worm (generally regarded as one of the top DK trinkets) is so toxic for my DK tank I would be better off with no trinket at all (it assigns a negative value.)\nÂ \nI believe this is related to negative values for stamina and health, despite this possibly being technically correct (still find that confusing.)",

      "Message": "This can't be right.  Rawr is telling me that my Symbiotic Worm is so toxic that it has a negative value of -18,630.  It is recommending some useless trinkets in its place but what it really means is it would prefer I just leave the slot empty.\r\n\r\nThere's no way the trinket is actually overall hurting me, right?  At worst its value is so diminished that it could approach 0 (which I'm also highly skeptical of, but save that for another time.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps what's missing here is a floor that prevents a total value from being driven below zero?\r\n\r\nIs there a discussion on burst / softcap you can point me to?  I had thought I was up on current DK theory but am not aware of this topic.",

      "Message": "Not a bug. With Burst abilities (cooldowns you activate) active, you are over soft cap. So more regular survival (like stamina) hurts Burst as more of the Burst gets converted downward by Softcap. It means with your cooldowns, you don't need to stack more Stam. If you think it's doing it too much you can devalue Burst calcs using the Options pane or increase your Hits to Survive, though the defaults should technically be accurate.\r\n\r\n\n\n** Closed by Jothay 4/11/2011 12:47 PM",

I'm sure there's bigger fish to fry.",
