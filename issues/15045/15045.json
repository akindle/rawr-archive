    "Description": "Description: I'd like to be able to pull up two saved character xml files and be able to compare them side by side to understand what is different about the equipment.  Basically the same thing as the optimizer does when it is finished so that it highlights the slots that are different so you can quickly compare them.\nÂ \nSuggestion for Fix: The way the optimizer does it is just fine.",

      "Message": "Unfortunately it's not as easy as just bringing in the optimizer.  Character XML files have more info in them than just gear.  Buffs, Talents, Options are also stored, and may be different.  To hook into the optimizer, we'd have to either:\r\n1) Add support to the optimizer results window that displays the difference between buffs/talents/options\r\nor\r\n2) Add some mechanism to this feature to normalize the buffs/talents/options (ie, always use the right side)\r\nor\r\n3) Simply check to see if they're different, and not allow you to continue (warning you that suchandsuch option is different)\r\n---\r\nReally, I also think that this information won't be useful without also comparing the output in the stats pane (how much DPS or avoidance or burst healing each character can do), so this would really need to be a freshly designed feature.  I don't have the time to, but maybe one of our other devs will have time at some point.\r\n\r\nLeaving this open for now, as it's a good suggestion",

      "Message": "I guess I'm looking for something simpler than that because I don't use the optimization of talents/buffs etc.. but I see your point.  Maybe you could do it in parts, just do an initial launch that only compares equipment for simple people like me and then when you can get around to it add the more sophisticated total comparison.  Frankly I don't even care about any sort of scoring or rating, just something that tells me what's different between where my char is now and the model I've created for the future.",

      "Message": "It looks to me that your main use case is comparing two xml for the same character that you created both yourself, most likely by modifying one to get to the other. For now you might want to use the Batch Tools which includes the character comparisons. Load your first character, then do any modifications to it in any way you want and then click on Diff button to compare it to the original saved character.",

      "Message": "Thanks, I'd seen the Diff function but it doesn't do what I need, or rather it does exactly what I need but it only does it on a character that you've just modified.  If I understand the functionality correctly, you can pull up an xml file, click the show button and then modify it.  You then click the diff button and it tells you what is different from the originally loaded file.  Unfortunately that doesn't help me because what I'm looking for is a tool that helps me remember what I changed and am working towards (or rather, what the optimizer changed previously).\r\n\r\nI think the funcionality is all there already, the only difference between what the diff button is doing and what I am looking for is to be able to select 2 rows in the batch tools section and hit the diff button and have them compared (i.e. instead of comparing a single row with its changed self, comparing two rows).  I thought it was going to work, I selected 2 rows (since it lets you select multiple) but no joy.\r\n\r\nSo the use case would be:\r\n- select XML1 in the batch tools window\r\n- select XML2 in the batch tools window on a different line\r\n- multi-select both XML1 and XML2\r\n- click Diff\r\n- magic happens\r\n- window is shownw with the delta's between the two xml files\r\n\r\nAlternately this would work (I tried it as well but it didn't seem to do anything)\r\n- Load XML1 into the main Rawr screen\r\n- Select batch tools\r\n- Load XML2 into the batch tools window\r\n- Click Diff\r\n- XML2 from batch tools window and XML1 from main Rawr screen are compared, magic happens\r\n- window is shownw with the delta's between the two xml files\r\n\r\nMake sense\r\n",
