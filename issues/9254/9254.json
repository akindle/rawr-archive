In WoW, this works out to -1.96% and -0.66% to be crit, for a total reduction of -2.62% to be crit.\nÂ \nRawr, despite having the same resilience and defense rating figures, has me at 0.0007153034% chance to be crit.",

      "Message": "Assuming the article here: http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/01/29/shifting-perspectives-hit-rating-expertise-and-defense-skill-f/ is correct. Then the bear is uncritable calculation is definitely off.\r\n\r\nThe Bear calculations are taking all defense rating and dividing by 60 to determine crit reduction when in fact it's closer to 59.10 for a direct defense rating to % crit reduction. This can be confirmed in game with the script \"/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(2.6-(GetCombatRatingBonus(CR_DEFENSE_SKILL)*.04+GetCombatRatingBonus(CR_CRIT_TAKEN_MELEE)),1,0.5,0)\". At 81 defense rating and 49 resilience in game shows uncritable but Rawr shows critable.\r\n\r\nI modified the crit reduction calculation in the function CharacterCalculationsBase GetCharacterCalculations(Character character, Item additionalItem) to read\r\n\"calculatedStats.CritReduction = (((float)Math.Floor(stats.DefenseRating * 0.423f)) / 25f) + (stats.Resilience / 39.423f);\"\r\n\r\nThis should properly convert defense rating to defense skill, round the defense skill down to the nearest integer, then convert that to % crit reduction. This all of course assumes that the linked article is correct in it's theory crafting.",

      "Message": "I believe that article is wrong. Its calculations are based on a macro based on the character sheet which has always rounded when it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nIf someone can do some tests with thousands of hits at these borderline def/resil cases, that'd be interesting. As it is, I'm going to go with the leading theorycraft, which also happens to be the most conservative.",

It would be interesting to see which is correct.\r\n\r\nOf note: The above is rounding down not up when converting defense rating to defense points. So that can't be where a rounding error is happening in game.",
