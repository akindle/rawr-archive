      "Message": "I've tested Rawr with someone from each of the new Brazilian realms including Azralon in the latest change set. Rawr does work on loading them. The reason you cannot load from Azralon, even though I said this issue has been fixed is due to the fact that it's fixed in the source code and there hasn't been a release since the update. We are going to be releasing a new version, which includes the Azralon change, either tomorrow or Monday.",
