    "Description": "Both Rawr and the add on are out of date understandably and like I read not much point in updating it with the expansion coming out real soon. My question is how do you manually add character talents with the new talent tree like it is? I read that that is how it needs to be done for the moment but it doesn't make sense.\nÂ \nOh and the Rawr add on wouldn't work at all in game.",
