    "Description": "Im currently specced SV, with a dual-spec for MM. But my gems and everything are all setup for SV.\n \nI would like to have this system optimize my gems and enchants for optimal dps in MM. But currently i dont believe it is. \n \nIt should recommend at least bringing me to ~500 ArmPen, but its not giving a single change that includes ArmPen and there is no way my gems are optimal for MM currently.\n \nIve attached the fully loaded save file\n \nPlease tell me what i did wrong (im sure its a user-error, as im a new user)",

      "Message": "Ok, now that that is settled, here are my notes:\r\n\r\n* You are more than 3% over Hit cap (8%), should really find some gear to drop your Hit as all that's going to waste. OYu have 109 Hit Rating you can free.\r\n* You should mark the following Enchants as available to the optimizer:\r\n- Back: Greater Speed\r\n- Hands: Major Agility, Crusher, Greater Blasting\r\n- Feet: Icewalker, Cat's Swfitness (you should always use Cat's Swiftness, I just haven't put the movement calcs into the model yet).\r\n- Weapons: Major Intellect, Exceptional Agility\r\n* Intellect presently has a higher value than it normally would due to you running OOM early (less than 3 minutes in). Add Runic Mana pot to help out a little, but you still need to find a few more replenishment sources or up your mana pool.\r\n* You have improved Arcane Shot but you aren't using Arcane Shot in your rotation\r\n* You set your file to optimize to Hunter DPS Rating, you should be optimizing for Overall as your Pet is a contributor and small tweaks to increase his DPS also helps yours.\r\n\r\n**** At your current stats, you cannot generate enough ArP with gems to overcome AGI in RSV's (that's 16 gems at 20 ArP each totalling 320 ArP, you need about 40 more than that to just barely hit the tipping point)\r\n\r\n\r\nI fixed a couple of these things, then ran the optimize at full thoroughness.\r\n\r\nIt upped the Overall from 8096 to 8210. Unfortunately you have no gear where it can drop the Hit you have but it was able to move some stats around to increase your mana pool. You also still can't generate enough ArP to make it worth going all out ArP and you probably won't until you replace that hit gear.",

      "Message": "Wow, thanks so much for your effort and feedback. \r\n\r\nI understand my natural HIT is wayyy over cap. I didnt think it would effect my ability to go MM tho. I appreciate all of your feedback, and will make an effort to drop the HIT gear and grab some ArmPen gear instead hopefully that will do the trick.\r\n\r\nThanks again, the support on this app is really amazing! \r\n",
