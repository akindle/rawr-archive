    "Description": "Demonic Pact warlocks bring a spell power raid buff using Demonic Pact. The goal of this feature is to enable optimizing gear for that spell power buff (10% of spell dmg). Currently, the optimizer will happily prioritize a 2 dps improvement over a 20 SP improvement (which brings 2 dps to everyone in the raid).\nÂ \nSuggestion: Add a criteria to the optimizer to set a priority to place on spell power (much like survivability for other classes).  Also enable setting a minimum (e.g., 2800 in order to be as good as totem of wrath).",
