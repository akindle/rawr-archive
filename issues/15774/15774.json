      "Message": "Notes from your Character File:\r\n- Enforce Gem Requirements wasn't set, this prevents the optimizer from using too many Dragonseye gems and makes sure your Meta is active with the proper requirements. As a Jewelcrafter this is especially important for you.\r\n- Turn on the 'Hide PvP Gear' and 'Hide Spell Gear' options, this cuts down on gear displayed and makes it easier on the Build Upgrade List feature\r\n- You had no Self-Buffs or Pet Buffs selected\r\n- Your Shot Rotation wasn't set up\r\n- Your Pet Talents were not set up\r\n- You have useless items selected, like fishing hats. This only serves to slow down the optimizer.\r\n- You have a lot of items selected per slot, I'd recommend at least dropping it to your top 2 per slot and uncheck the rest\r\n\r\nOnce I fixed half that stuff above, Agility went WAY up in the RSV's and it no longer recommended ArP/Haste and wants Agi now.",
