    "Description": "The custom item filters are not working. I tried to create one for \"Trophy of the Crusade\" and one for \"Protector's Mark of Sanctification\".\nÂ \nNeither of them worked no matter how I entered them. I did use different combinations of regex, and non-regex to try to make them work. I verified my regex using http://gskinner.com/RegExr/",

      "Message": "This was because I was creating a second filter to negate what was in another preset filter. There already was a value inserted into the Armor Tokens filter (which I had enabled), then I was trying to negate that with my custom filter, and it didn't work.\r\n\r\nI'm changing the priority on the bug to lower, in that, when a user creates a custom filter, it should supersede any existing filters to prevent confusion.",

Either I'm extremely stupid, too close to the problem, or the functionality isn't as straightforward as it needs to be)\r\n\r\nIf it can't be done, or requires some work on the back end to make it possible, then the defect stands (maybe with a different name and description, but still...)",
