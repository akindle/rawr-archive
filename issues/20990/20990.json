    "Description": "Right now the layout of the WPF user interface does not react well to high-dpi displays (or low resolution displays for that matter). The equipment slots along the left and right sides of the paperdoll \"wrap\" to a new column - rather than staying in their single column and getting smaller.\n \ni check \"Enable Compact Paper Doll Mode*\"  \n      *Hides the Shirt and Tabard slots and moves the Gloves to the left side.\n       Use on low resolution monitors.\n \nand the software *almost* becomes usable, but not quite there.\n \nThe better solution is to scale properly with resolution; don't wrap equipment slots. The rest of the UI already reacts pretty well to changes in DPI setting.\n \nReal resolution: 1680x1050\nDPI setting: 131dpi\nRelative resolution: 1231x768  (i.e. 1680x1050  *96/131 = 1231x768)",

      "Message": "To clarify, it's a lot 'better' in Win7 than previously, and especially in WPF (which is what Rawr is written in). But the bottom line is that you have explicitly chosen to scale up all content, and Rawr is following that scaling. That makes it all the buttons too large to fit in one column, so it wraps. Simple as that. Fix it by fixing your scaling.",
