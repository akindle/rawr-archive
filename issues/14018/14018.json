    "Description": "I did a complete re-installation of my PC last week. Before setting up everywhing, Rawr worked fine on my Win XP system. Now however it seems like I can't start any of the Rawr versions. I tried v2.2.12, 2.2.14 and 2.2.13. Whenever I start Rawr, I get a (german since it is a german XP) message telling me that this programm could not be initialized (0x0000135), and that's all I get. I guess some kind of support program ist missing",
