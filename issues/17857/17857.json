    "Description": "I get the message one or more of your items is missing Display Information, please update your item cache whenever I try to view 3D WoWHead Model. However, it continues to give the same error after updating my item cache (which I have now done several times from both wowhead and the armory). It's getting to be a real pain, I had the same issue with 2.3.18 and 2.3.13 of Rawr. Any ideas? Regards Andrew",

Before adding, click Browse button below and open the location where your toon was saved. double click and make sure it shows up in box then hit \"Add Comment\" button.\r\nBTW, if you are never saving your toon you are causing yourself more work by having to reselect all the buffs each and every time you use Rawr. and if you are not using buffs you are not getting truly helpful results from using Rawr.",
