    "Description": "Rawr b4.0.10.0\n \nOpen Rawr, open the filters pane, apply the \"Reset\" button.  Observe many items in the \"head\" slot.\n \nNow Disable 359-378 Tier 11 and observe that \"Membrane of C'Thun\" disappears from the list, as expected.\n \nClose and re-open Rawr.  Open the filters pane again and drill down into the \"Disable Item Level\" branch.  Observe that although \"Disable 359-378 Tier 11\" is checked, \"Disable by item level\" doesn't show the \"some children checked\" indicator and that \"Membrane of C'Thun\" is visible again.\n \nWorkround: unchecking and re-checking \"Disable 359-378 Tier 11\" sets the \"some checked\" indicator on \"Disable by Item level\" and also makes \"Membrane of C'Thun\" disappear again.",
