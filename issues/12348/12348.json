    "Description": "Almost everything about survival hunter is broken.  Health doesn't appear to increase AP (Hunter vs. Wild talent), I don't think expose weakness affects anything, and I don't think Improved Tracking does anything either. It really needs some work.  \nÂ \nLooking forward to the next release, hopefully some of these issues will be resolved.\noh, and maybe glyph support too :)",
