    "Description": "How about adding another \"comparison view\" similar to the \"Current Gear/Enchants/Buffs\" one that shows how to acquire each of the items you currently have equipped?  Basically a sorted shopping list you could save to a file (and perhaps print):\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCharacter Name/Level\nTalent Build Name(n/0/0)\nDate Time\nOverall DPS/Survivability/etc\n \nItem Name   Location/Boss/Price    Drop Rate  DPS/Survivability/etc \n \n<sorted list of currently equipped items>\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------",

      "Message": "That's typically correct, wildebees, but it doesn't have to be that way. Many people do use entirely separate character files to build their target gear set, which is totally valid, as long as they understand how everything works. I'm sure tkb does know all that, as he's been around here for quite a while. :)\r\n\r\ntkb, can you try the export to CSV, from the Current Gear/Enchants/Buffs list? Apart from including Buffs, is that the data you're looking for?",
