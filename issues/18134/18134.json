    "Description": "When running Rawr 3 on a Mac, the Filter pull-down doesn't give any options. The pull-down comes up but is completely blank. This is true whether running in FireFox, Safari, or outside of the browser. The same version of Rawr, when run in the same version of FireFox on Windows XP, displays the Filter options correctly.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n \n1. Launch Rawr 3\n2. Load a character (mine is attached, but any character will do)\n3. Select the Filter pull-down\n4. Observe that there is no visible content in the pull-down\n \nAdditional Information:\n \nMac OS 10.6.3\nRawr version in \"About Rawr\" shows as 1.0, but this is the latest 3.0 beta\nFireFox 3.6.3 or Safari 5.0 (6533.16)",
