    "Description": "I'm a mage and I've been using a staff and I just got a good one-hand, so I ran Optimizer with the JP off-hand selected to see what it recommended. To my surprise, it recommended enchanting the one-hand with Greater Spellpower (Staff)!\nÂ \nAttached is my file in which I still have the staff equipped but the new gear is marked available.",
