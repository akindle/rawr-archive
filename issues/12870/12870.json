    "Description": "I posted this in the discussion thread so I apologize if I am overposting. I figured it was more appropriate here as it appears to be more of a bug/issue as opposed to a topic of discussion...\n \nIn the gem menu the Reckless Monarch Topaz (+spl pwr / +haste) shows up for me as a ZERO dps gain. The Quick Autumn's Glow (+haste) shows up as a ZERO dps gain as well. The Quick Dragon's Eye does show a 7.25 dps gain so extra +haste does give some dps benefit. The Runed Scarlet Ruby (+spl pwr) shows a 29.60 dps. The Runed Dragon's Eye shows a 41.19 dps gain.\n \nThe Veiled Monarch Topaz (+hit / +spl pwr) shows an 18.78 dps gain. I'm currently optomized 4 points under the hit cap, so some of the gain with the Veiled Monarch is from +hit, some from +spl pwr.\n \nI would think the Reckless Monarch would indicate some type of DPS gain from the +spl pwr alone... even if the haste rating I have has hit some sort of soft cap (currently at 28.61% haste total with 661 haste rating from gear). I don't think any type of soft cap has been reached, as the Quick Dragon's Eye is still showing a dps boost for me.\n \nI'm using the 2.2.0B3 build still as it models the talents from 3.0.9 live, but I've noticed the same issues in the 2.2.0B5 build when modeling the new warlock talents as well.\n \nIs Rawr just not evaluating the Reckless Topaz and Quick Autumn's Glow correctly? I looked at the item settings with the item editor and they look accurate to me, but then again I'm not a coder.",

      "Message": "To provide further detail, from the Elitist Jerks thread on their warlock forums the aprox. scaling factors for an Affliction build are...\r\n\r\nWarlock_T8_53_00_18 intellect=0.19 spirit=0.77 spell_power=1.54 hit_rating=1.91 crit_rating=0.74 haste_rating=0.96\r\n\r\nThis is using the 3.1.0 talent models and T8 level gear so the scaling is a bit off, but it is roughly in line with 3.0.9 and T7.5 gear as well.  The +32 spl dmg Runed Dragon's Eye would be a 49.28 dps gain, where as Rawr shows a 41.19 dps gain.  I would attribute this to some of the talent differences between 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 along with Rawr not modeling the drain soul execute dps boost for affliction locks.  \r\n\r\nDoing the math using Rawr's model would equate +1 spl dmg to 1.28 dps gain.  This doesn't translate exactly to the Runed Scarlet Ruby as it would show +1 spl dmg equaling 1.55 dps gain.  I'm not sure why the 2 gems don't scale identically.\r\n\r\nThe Quick Dragon's Eye should scale to a 25.92 dps gain, where as Rawr only shows a 7.25 dps gain.  I'm not sure what the big difference is here, but doing the math on it would indicate a scaling factor of .26 dps gain per haste rating point.\r\n\r\nTaking the math a step further the and assuming the scaling factors Rawr uses for the Runed Scarlet Ruby and the Quick Autumn's Glow (+spl and +haste) the Reckless Monarch Topaz SHOULD give a 13.95 dps gain from spl pwr and 2.08 dps gain from haste, giving 16.03 overall dps gain for the gem.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the scaling factors are inconsistent.  I know Simcraft and Rawr use different models and function differently, but I would assume scaling would at least be uniform within Rawr when comparing the same stat (spl pwr, haste, crit, etc).\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "I'm guessing the problem is that the value of haste isn't linear. Due to the reliance on DoT durations, you end up with discreet numbers of filler shadowbolts between DoT reapplications. I know that that can be smoothed out, but it's still going to be a problem of some sort, I expect.
