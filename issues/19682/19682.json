    "Description": "When I put AoE uptime to 1, the dps of Living Bomb doesn't change, nor does FBLBPyro rotation. Instead, Rawr starts to recommend that I spam Dragon's Breath for the whole fight, even though my Blast Wave + free Flamestrike would be superior damage if used on CD. Also, Living Bomb is shown on the cycles list as having high dps (for me it's like 19kdps), which I suspect is because Rawr is calculating average damage per single GCD, as opposed to looking at it over the full duration.",
