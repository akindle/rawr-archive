      "Message": "If you cap against 102.4% combat table coverage, then you are covered against level 88 raid bosses.  Rawr will show you at 100% combat table coverage if you are capped versus whatever level boss you selected in the boss handler, which defaults to a raid boss of level 88.  Again, for the current version, remember to take off any avoidance/mastery procs before you check your combat table coverage.",
