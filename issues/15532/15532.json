    "Description": "Usually I run raids with a holy build focused on maximizing Renew's output. Until today I just used the preset role \"Holy-Raid\" since Flash Heal and Renew are quite equal in use and kept in mind Rawr could not be overly exact that way.\nBut when I wanted Rawr to model a build with 3/3 Mental Agility I've just seen no way to get that done.\nFor me Custom Role seems unsatisfying since it never used to advice socketing for mana reg even when inputting fights where I had gone out of mana.\nSo I just wanted to ask for the implementation of a preset role focusing on Renew, CoH, PoM, PoH and SoL-Procs.",

      "Message": "Good request, I'll do what I can see.\r\nI can easily make a CoH -ProM-Renew/SoL-ProcxX option. Not sure how often you'd cast ProH however. (in ratio to the other spells). Perhaps a WWS or similar from the fights you find toughest to help me see exactly what you are asking for?",

      "Message": "In fact my use of PoH varies from fight to fight due to its group-limitation. For myself I took those two fights when evaluating gear via Rawr's Custom Role:\r\n\r\nNorthrend Beasts Heroic because of the heavy use of PoH in phase 1 and 2 and the mana concerns coming with it:\r\nhttp://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/8cntj3aoefo2naq1/details/3/?s=2800&e=3344\r\nAnd Deathbringer Saurfang because of never experiencing any mana issues with this encounter (maybe due to the lack of raid damage at the start):\r\nhttp://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/4bmbw8jvcx5w0yqt/details/7/?s=7768&e=8094\r\n\r\nI am sorry those are German logs, but when hovering above spells you are getting English Tooltips. If you wish I could also upload my .xml's for the fights.",
