      "Message": "The suggestion for dividing the \"Omnitron Defense System\" and it's individual Boss Drops is a good idea. As for being able to replicate your findings for the \"Power Generation Hood\", upon refreshing from wowhead, I get \"Not Found on Armory\" so there was no information to filter. I will continue to monitor this issue, but it may also be an issue for the parcing team.",

      "Message": "The problem right now is items from Omnitron drop from multiple bosses (Toxitron and Arcanotron share drop loots, I believe those two are correct). However the the wowhead import doesn't support definitively multiple source information. Because of this, it is having issues. I added manually the source information for Omnitron. Same problem with Valiona & Theralion. Some items drop from both of them (though not all).",
