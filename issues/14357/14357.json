    "Description": "I've spent about 5k plus gold on re-socketing gems over and over again the last month.  Sources tell me that hit cap and expertise cap are vital for dps yet RAWR tells me to stack strength gems.   Should I ignore going after these hit and expertise caps?   I mananged to acquire both caps but at the expense of losing several strength gems and have seen about a 500 dps loss.   I am at a loss for dps as a warrior.   What gems get priority as a warrior dps strength, hit, or expertise?   In addition does RAWR account hit and expertise rating into its dps model?\n \nMy character name is Louferrigno and is on the Deathwing server.\n \nOne last question I have atm is whether or not i should roll fury once I get another edge of ruin form Htoc?",

      "Message": "If you're arms, the current information out there is that Expertise is not your strongest stat pre-cap, due to Overpower.  This doesn't make Expertise BAD, it just means that if you have the choice, you'll get more out of a 20str gem then you would a 20exp gem.\r\n\r\nHit cap, on the other hand, is pretty much required; if you ever see Rawr suggesting strength over hit gems, post your character file, because either you're doing something wrong or you found a bug.\r\n---\r\nOne big thing to check is that you have hit and expertise gems marked as available.  On the right side of the main screen of Rawr, click the \"Gear\" dropdown box and make it say \"Gems\".  Then, click on the gems you want to consider using -- you should see a green diamond.  Then optimize, and see if you get better results.",
