      "Message": "Can you tell us your character name and server name? My initial tests show the bug to be different. I am seeing results on v2.2.23 that the 3 pts racial bonus is not being applied at all. I base this assertion on doing some random samples of lvl 80 human rogues carrying swords that I find in the armory against their non-sword wielding brethren. To state the obvious: my tests showed the non-sword wielding rogues had the same expertise value in Rawr and Armory. Sword wielding human rogues had a 3 pt difference between Rawr and Armory.",

In finding that fact, I did validate your statement that Rawr is indeed adding 5 pts instead of 3pts. It is also only adding them for one-handed maces and swords only. ",
