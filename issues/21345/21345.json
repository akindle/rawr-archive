    "Description": "I opened up a month old Fire file I had on my computer and updated it with items I've gotten since I last ran the file. When I went to the Optimizer, I changed the condition to have a Haste Rating of <= 2000 (so that it would hit the 1996 Haste rating soft-cap needed for 3 extra ticks of Combustion with a little ley-way for reforging). After running the optimizer, the item listing on the right side was giving an odd behavior in that only the top handful of items were giving any meaningful numbers. The rest were giving less than a point or even 0 point value to the items.",
