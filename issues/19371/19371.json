    "Description": "In changeset 56330, I added the stat BonusWhiteDamageMultiplier to the stats pane so that Unheeded Warning could be modeled. The trinket's on use effect increases melee Auto attacks damage by 25% for 10 seconds with a 50 second ICD (according to Elitist Jerk's Rogue community). In order for this to function correctly in Rawr, all melee devs need to add support to this stat in some way or form.\nÂ \nI could not use PhysicalDamage for Unheeded Warning given that this would have increased all damage, not JUST White Damage. DK's have % White Damage as Frost [BonusFrostWeaponDamage] (which I'm not 100% sure how it relates) but again that is only related to DKs and not something usable by other melee classes.",
