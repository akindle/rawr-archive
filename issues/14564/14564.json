    "Description": "I am not certain if this is warlock specific or not.  I am not certain if the upgrade value of the item is correct or not.\n \nFor several releases I have seen that two handed items in my warlock's upgrade list also have an off hand in the list of items associated with the gearset that is used to arrive at the fact that the weapon is an upgrade.  I am not certain if this is just a display error or if Rawr! is using the offhand's stats and the 2H stats in its calculation.\n \nIf you open the attached upgrade list and then roll over any of the 2H weapons (Clemency, Relentless Gladiator's Combat Staff, Cold Convergence, etc) you will see that the list of gear used to calculate the upgrade includes my offhand (Symbol of Transgression or Surplus Limb).\n \nI looked through all 350+ issues and I didnt see it mentioned in the open issues.",
