    "Description": "When I load my character from the armory, it doesnt load my talents... Also, the model (which is 'Bear' at startup) switches to 'Tree' after it loads my character.... \nÂ \nIn 2.2.11 this does work so its not a problem from within the armory I reckon :)",

      "Message": "You will need a C# compiler, like Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition. \r\nUse it to open the project file (rawr.csproj or rawr.sln). Click on Build->Build Solution. With a slighty pinch of luck, it will create a rawr.exe file in the Rawr\\bin\\Debug or Rawr\\bin\\Release directory, depending on settings. \r\nThere will probably also be a Data sub-directory into which you might want to copy your itemcache files. (Depending on how you downloaded the source files, you might have an empty item cache. Grab the xml files from the data sub-dir of your release version of rawr and place them into this new sub-dir. Or try replacing the exe and dll files in your release rawr version with the newly created files.)\r\n\r\nIf all of this sounds too complicated, wait a day or two, there will probably be another few quick releases as we try to nail down more 3.2 changes.\r\n",
