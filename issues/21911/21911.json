    "Description": "OK in feral dps , I have 384 Maxtrix, 378 Hunger, according to RAWR with t13 4pc my dps is around 35862. Now RAWR says that the upgrades to 378 Hungerer are a slew of 346 tia/s grace's and most of all If i use Fluid death (359) with the matrix my dps goes from 35862 to 38597? Thats 3000 dps on a 359 trinket that supposedly the only other trinkets over it are Both Wrath of Unchaning. How can Fluid Death be 3rd BIS , please tell me this is a coding error as I have a 4pc t13 and cant try to test this without being in a raid , I would like to know if this is a coding error, as all New Dragon soul trinkets are placed below Fluid Death other than the Wraths of Unchaining?",
