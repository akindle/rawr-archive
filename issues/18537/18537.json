    "Description": "I'm having this issue in Rawr 2.3.21, Rawr3, EJ Spreadsheet\nÂ \nFor some reason when I have the Death's Choice equipped the spreadsheets and rawr versions keep telling me to gem hit even though I'm close to 440 hit and under the expertise cap. This can't be right can it? I thought it was for a while but something has to be wrong because whenever I switch the trinket it looks to resolve the issue.",
