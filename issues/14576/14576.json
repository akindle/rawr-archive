    "Description": "Tried to import my character from the armory - Fuseitana of Korialstrasz, and got an overflow error, details in attached file.\n \nIf I choose Continue, the character shows up with the equipped gear but the Comparisons panel has a big red X through it.  No gear or enchant selections show up.\n \nv2.2.24 has been working fine while this character was in Enh spec, it only started giving errors when I switched to my Resto spec.  This also happens when I try to load this character / spec combo from character profiler.",

      "Message": "Well, I loaded you up in my development copy just now and saw some definite funkiness. As soon as I changed your meta gem to something supported by the RestoSham model, everything started working normally, so if that doesn't fix it in your version (which should be 2.2.27 now), it's probably fixed for 2.2.28.\r\n\r\nTransmute yourself an Earthsiege Diamond and get a friend to cut it Insightful and you'll be all set. ^^\r\n\r\nThis is still a bug though, an invalid meta shouldn't break the model.\r\n",
