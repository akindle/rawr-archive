    "Description": "I posted on MMO-Champions, but here it is for the official tracker...basically, I figured out what is making the drastic difference in DPS--it's Rawr's mana calculations option.  For whatever reason, Rawr thinks that I'll OOM more often with the different build than Enhsim does.  The files you will want as a reference are linked below directly to the post I attached them in on mmo-champion.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Thanks.\nÂ \nIt's the post linked here as well as the one after it.  Thanks.\nhttp://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/rawr-enhance-enhancement-shaman-dps-calculator/msg1931992/#msg1931992",

      "Message": "Your original post was \"found a possible glitch or misdetection in Rawr, levaa...basically, I'm testing some various talent builds, since I don't have an issue with mana...so I'm dropping clearcasting and imp SS, giving me 2 extra points...I figure topping of Imp Shields with the extra 2 points would be a bigger benefit, but Rawr says putting 2 into Ancestral Knowledge is better...the 3/5 & 2/3 isn't better, so the threshold for Rawr is actually the 4/5 & 1/3 mark for some reason...I did enhsim on both talent specs (4/5|1/3 & 2/5|3/3) and in enhsim it says that capping shields is about a 30 DPS improvement, whereas Rawr puts my DPS at ~700 DPS improvement with 4/5 AK.  Figured I'd post everything here, so the guru's can take a look Smiley  Not sure which one is off, but I'd be interested in finding out.  Let me know if you need anything else, thanks.\"",
