I have tried this on three different machines (all running 64-bit Windows 7). Character XML file is attached.",

      "Message": "I can't reproduce this. Here is what I see. After load the solution is showing ... indicating advanced solver in progress. I check reconstruct sequence and wait for advanced solver to finish. It ends at round 900 reaching the set computation limit and shows the message box informing of this. After that the solution is displayed, including the sequence reconstruction.\r\n\r\nCan you explain a bit more in detail where your behavior starts to differ from this?",

Here is a link to a 45 second screen cap I did showing you my steps.  The program will stay in that not responding state until I end it manually.  I've let it sit for over an hour, and I've been using Rawr for quite a while now so I have no expectations of anything being instant.     http://screencast.com/t/ZTMxY2RlY",
