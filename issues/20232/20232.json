    "Description": "Thondroril Amulet of the Zephyr is not exporting from the add-on with the proper suffix.  The item is equipped and has also been reforged Haste->Crit.  I have added the item with the random suffixes but the item isn't exporting properly.  I have manually selected it and can work around it but I thought you might want to look at the export.  The part of the export in question is below.\nÂ \n<Neck>55404.0.0.0.0.152.0</Neck>",
