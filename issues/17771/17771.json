    "Description": "I get two different DPS calculations and two different gemming recommendations after running optimization. RAWR3 says I have 10k DPS and 2.3.17 says I have 12k DPS, not including pet. RAWR3 says I need to gem Haste gems and 2.3.17 says I need to gem Hit. Is there a difference in the model loaded into RAWR3 than 2.3.17?",
