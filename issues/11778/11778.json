    "Description": "Values appear in edit item. They don't appear on mouse over in the gear comparison lists. Armor pen doesn't seem to change the ranking of pieces of gear. Upon editing an item to have, say, 5000 armor penetration, it's ranking doesn't change. I observed this issue in the retribution paladin module and in the rogue module.",
