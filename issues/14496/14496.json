Downgrade to Mono 2.2 until they finally get around to fixing it.  Speaking of which, Astrylian, please make sure you let us know if that ever happens.",

      "Message": "Is the call to bmPhoto.SetResolution() in ItemIcons.ScaleByPercent (itemicons.cs line 383) strictly necessary? Unless you're planning on printing the image out, the resolution is irrelevent.\r\nRunning under mono 2.4, you can simply comment out the call and everything seems to work. Could somebody check if that works under Windows as well?",
