    "Description": "As a note to http://rawr.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=16951\n \nAs a slight tempering in the poster's favour...  The \"issues\" page doesn't have posting guidelines, only the discussions page has them, granted that one refers to posting issues as well, but it's a 2 step thing.  Is it possible to have a link/explanation on the \"create new issue\" page ?   Maybe even outline how to set a proper title so it includes what part of rawr the issue deals with ?\n \nAs to the bug report guidelines:\nhttp://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=BugReportingFormatGuide&referringTitle=PostingGuidelines\nIt doesn't mention anywhere that people should post their character files, and/or when the character files would be relevant (not all issues will be helped by posting them as well).\nThe guidelines probably need to be amended, don't slap people on the head for not posting their character files right away when it's not mentioned anywhere they should do so. :-)",
