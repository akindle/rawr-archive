    "Description": "I'm not sure this is an issue - it may be something I missed in patch 3.3, and if so I apologize. It just seems odd to me that suddenly Berserking has taken a nosedive for me in DPS value, and every single weapon currently has Mongoose recommended instead. What makes me think this may be an issue is that I've tried replacing an item or two to go back to the configuration I had when Berserking was recommended, and Mongoose still shows top of the list now, so it doesn't seem that I've reached some turning-point threshold.",
