      "Message": "Okay, I found the source of your issue and fixed it.  What happened was, the model was predicting that you would, on average, gain more mana per cast than the spell actually cost; that is to say, your spell rotation was mana positive (your blue bar would stay full the entire fight).  This caused some weird negative values in the model, so I put in a check to find this condition and simply tell it that you would never run out of mana in the fight.  I'm curious to know if it's actually possible for a Moonkin to go mana positive, though.",
