    "Description": "The 2-piece T8 set bonus ( http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=64938#comments ) is being valued far too high in the attached character file. When I look at the DPS of the current buffs this file says that the 2-piece T8 bonus is giving me 123 DPS, however if I remove the set bonus and simply add a static 150 Haste I only see a 58 DPS increase.\n \nThe buff granted by the set bonus does not stack, but can be re-freshed when it is up. In any case, there should be no way that the set bonus will give a larger DPS bonus then 150 static Haste. Also, I was trying follow the logic of how this gets triggered (it is late, so I very possibly could have missed something), but I cannot find where it accounts for the 40% proc rate on a HS or Slam crit. It seems to be at a 100% proc rate.\n \n~Droid",
