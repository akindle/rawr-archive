    "Description": "I often have badges that I want to use to purchase items for my toon, and have to decide how to best optimize my use of those badges.  I end up manually pretending I have a new item; optimizing to see how much it improves things, removing that item, and then pretending I have a different item.  I repeat this process several times until I can decide which item(s) best optimize my dps or healing.\n \nThis seems like it could be an automatable process, much like the current gear optimization process.  It would speed the examination of alternatives, and seems like it could leverage the basic algorithms already built into rawr.\n \nAnyway, I hope you can consider this request.\n \nThanks for maintining Rawr by the way...",
