In the Comparisons pane on the left, switch the view to Slot: Current Gear/Enchants/Buffs\n4. Click on the Export menu and select Copy Data to Clipboard\n \nExpected result:  Data is copied to the clipboard in CSV format.\nActual result: Nothing is copied to the clipboard\n \n5. Click on the Export menu and select Export to CSV... and pick a file to save the data to.\n \nExpected result:  File is created/updated with the data\nActual result: Error message pops up stating \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\"\n \n \nNote: The Export to Image... options works as expected, the other two do not.",
