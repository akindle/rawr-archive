    "Description": "FilterList currently removes all items that are dominated. This is not desired behavior for rings. If the best ring dominates 2nd best ring and both are unique then 2nd best should not be filtered out.\nÂ \nAlso when you're comparing for dominance an item can dominate more than one (you could have stats (2,4) on one, (4,2) on second which would both be added, item (5,5) then dominates both).",
