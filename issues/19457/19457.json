    "Description": "Since spirit and hit are treated the same for all calculation in the Moonkin model, rather than preferring hit over spirit for reforge, could we have an option to decide which to prefer?  If you are Balance/Feral, then you might choose hit for the very slight advantage of hit over spirit for your trees. If you are Balance/Resto, you might prefer spirit since much of the gear is otherwise identical between those two specs.",

      "Message": "I'd like to verify that we're talking about the same thing.  Item # 19318 was an issue where Rawr was sometimes recommending reforging hit->spirit and then on another run recommending reforging spirit->hit since in the moonkin model these two stats are identical for dps calculations.  The fix for that was to no longer consider hit->spirit or spirit->hit as valid reforges and if another stat could be reforged into either hit or spirit, Rawr chose to always reforge into hit.  These changes are in the current top of tree.  This request is to allow the user to specify a preference between reforging into hit or reforging into spirit when both are options rather than always choosing to reforge into hit.\r\n\r\nFor future reference:, When there is a followup question on a closed item, is the preferred action to a) re-open the item; b) leave it closed and add a comment; c) create a new item; d) something else?",
