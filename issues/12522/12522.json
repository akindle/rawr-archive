    "Description": "Using an ungeared an untalented lvl 80 troll shaman, I've noticed that several constants seem to be off.\n \n1) Base Intellect for Troll in GetCharacterStats should be 124 not 136.  Makeing this change will make Rawr match the paper doll for Intellect, Mana, and Spell Crit.\n \n2) The mana regen constant in CharacterCalculationsBase should be 0.005575f.  Making this change will make MP5 shown by Rawr match the paper doll.\n \n3) The list under \"public override List<Item.ItemType> RelevantItemTypes\" should contain Item.ItemType.FistWeapon since there are now caster fist weapons (well weapon).",

Each point increases spell crit by 2%.\r\n\r\n6) In GetCharacterStats, in the calcualtion for Intellect, statsTotal needs to be broken up into at least statsRace and the rest before being multiplied out  as shown below.  Further investigation is needed to see if the other parts need to be multiplied seprate or not:\r\n            statsTotal.Intellect = \r\n                (float)Math.Floor((statsRace.Intellect) * (1 + (statsTotal.BonusIntellectMultiplier + (.02f * character.ShamanTalents.AncestralKnowledge)))) +\r\n                (float)Math.Floor((statsBaseGear.Intellect + statsEnchants.Intellect + statsBuffs.Intellect) * (1 + (statsTotal.BonusIntellectMultiplier + (.02f * character.ShamanTalents.AncestralKnowledge))));\r\n\r\n7) In the same function, the calculatino for SpellPower needs to use Floor instead of Round.",

I've been keeping away from the base calcs as I've been careful since the original code wasn't written by me, but your ideas make more sense then what was there before.\r\n\r\nIn regards to 8, 5, and 10, those were just visual, the actual %'s for haste and crit were correct in the calculations, I've made the visuals reflect it now correctly.\r\n\r\nFixed the Earthliving Weapon bonus to be correct at 10% instead of 1. (9)\r\n\r\nFor (2), I've removed out of 5 second regen.  We have no talents that use it, the the amount we are out of 5 seconds is miniscule.  If a trinket or talent changes in the future, the calculations have been commented out, but for now it's just not necessary much like paladin.\r\n\r\n(3) has been fixed soon after 2.1.9 was released, so should be in next build.  \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting all of this and the suggestions, helped me clean out some skeletons of the old code.",
