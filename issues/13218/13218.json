    "Description": "I've been using Rawr for a while now and just today I encountered an issue with the program closing when trying to save a character or when trying to load a previously saved character file.  I deleted all old files, reinstalled the program, and the issue persists.  There are no error messages popping up, just closes down and disappears.  Anyone familiar with this problem?",
