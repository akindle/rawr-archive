    "Description": "The hunter T9 ilvl 245 helm has no socket bonus. This results in some weird optimizations. I have to manually add it back in by right clicking on it and selecting edit. Every new version, I have to do this. Just thought you should know!\nÂ \nMay also effect the T9 258 and 232 helms. Might want to check that.",
