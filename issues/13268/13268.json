    "Description": "Dear developer,\n \nI use your tool to improve my gearset.\nIf you look at the Slot Gear / Head you can see that my current head gemming is regarded 3,92 dps to low.\nYou tool suggests to regem. I gain 10 points of spell power but loose 16 haste. For me there seems to be a mistake.\nIf I neglect in the calculation the loss of 8 haste by loosing the socket bonus, can understand you result but not now.\n \nYours sincerely\n \nMeisterLi, Rat von Dalaran Germany",
