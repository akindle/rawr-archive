There is an outdated link in the email, which points to the original 4.0 announcment page (now retired).\n \nI suggest changing the link to the Version Notes (http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=VersionNotes) page.\n \nHere's the top of the message I get:\n \n    New release \"Rawr 4.1.05\" for project rawr\n    Rawr is now web-based. The link to use Rawr4 is: http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php\n    This is the Cataclysm Release.
