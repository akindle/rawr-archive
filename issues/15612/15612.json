    "Description": "Issue has been going on since 2.3.2. Enchants are showing a negative value on all slots. No matter which enchant is selected, it is placed at the bottom of the list. on the Main list window on the right, selecting the Enchant>(any slot) you can see the listing and the enchant currently on the item having a negative value. Like on the shoulder enchant, shows -979.25 Survival. The only reason I disable all buffs is to get unbuffed numbers. (Also to note that unbuffed numbers are no where close to the ingame numbers. All avoidance along with hit and expertise number still wrong. This one has been going on for sometime and I have lived with that.)\n \n   1. Launch Rawr\n   2. File > Load from Armory...\n   3. Character Name: Zeo\n       Realm: Greymane\n       Region: US\n   4. Tools > Disable all buffs\n   5. Observe that Rawr shows negative values on enchants. \n \nRawr v2.3.40\nWindows XP SP3\n(Uploaded a test version of the character.)",

      "Message": "Regarding \"All avoidance along with hit and expertise number still wrong\" those numbers change against a target level other than 80. The paper doll in game and armory only shows a target of 80 but in Rawr when you select a level 83 target you see the real numbers you are getting.",
