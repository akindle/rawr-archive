    "Description": "In my 56/8/7 blood tanking spec with gear from heroic instances, triumph badges and a few crafted items, RAWR calculates a TPS value of 16660,8. I selected vampiric blood, rune strike and death strike glyphs and the only raid buff I selected is horn of winter.\nI have tested my actual TPS for about 1 hour against the elite bone sentinels in Icecrown and it averages out to about 6500, sometimes a little higher. The rotation I used was a standard IT-PS-HS-HS-DS-DC-DS-HS-HS-HS-HS-DC.\nFor my DW-frost spec, I get TPS calculations of about 7200 TPS, which I have no problem replicating against those same elite mobs.\nIs the difference in calculated and actual TPS maybe an error in the TankDK module?",
