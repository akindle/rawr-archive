    "Description": "When I do a new optimise after getting a new piece of gear, it would be very useful to get a list of the new gems & enchants you need to buy.   This could be listed just under the \"Score after optimisation\" something like: -\n \n3x Fractured Cardinal Rubies\n2x Deft Ametrines\n1x Enchant Weapon: Beserking\n1x Enchant Boots: Icewalker\n1x Nerubian Leg Reinforcements\n \nAll this info is available on that screen, but when I am having to switch to various alts to buy/make the gems and enchants it would be convenient.     It would be fantastic if you got a summary of all the enchanting mats needed but I understand that may be a lot more work than its worth.     Nothing life-changing here, but it would be a nice convenience.",
