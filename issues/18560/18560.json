    "Description": "Several versions later and the cloak is still not right in the item database that comes with rawr.\nCan you maybe fix it in a way that we don't have to manually fix this every time?\n \nI know there are a couple of issues created and are said to be solved, but i just got Rawr 2.3.22 and it's still wrong.\nManually changed it to:\nArmor: 159\nBonus Armor: 490\n \nThis is the info that wowhead gives too.\nBut on a fresh install of rawr it still does the armor as 549",
