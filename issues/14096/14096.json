      "Message": "Since, I test a lot of things and i think that 4p T8 + immolation + glyph of conflag is the source of problem. When i activate immolation with 4p and glyph it crashs but when i desactivate the glyph and then i activate immolation it works normally !\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't care about this bugs because I have 2p t9, but the bug of the glyph of conflag which decreases DPS is very boring",
