    "Description": "Recently actually using Rawr in anger rather than just programming it I noticed an annoying feature. The filters are set globally and not apparently per character. The result is if I am trying to use Rawr for my main who is doing ToGC25 I need one set of filters enabled. If I am using Rawr for my alt DK tank or alt holy priest these are basically heroic gearing/Ulduar gearing and so when I change the character I need to change all the filters around, to suit what that character needs.\nÂ \nCan we add a feature to save the filter settings with the character XML and to load them back again when you reload that character. This would then store the appropriate filters with the character so that when you reload the character you automatically have the right filters setup.",

However I don't think Rawr should really treat these cases.",
