By left clicking on an item slot and opening the list of upgrades and then immediately clicking on a different slot it was freezing consistantly.  \r\n\r\nI just rebooted my XP system and I can no longer get this to happen.  rebooting didnt affect the vista system the other night and it happened several times there.  I will investigate further tonight when I get home.\r\n\r\n",
