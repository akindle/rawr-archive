    "Description": "A few things regarding the Upgrade list that I feel would be an improvement. I am not sre if this is the right place to create the request, or if I should open an issue...\n \n1. It would be nice if the list printed as well as saved, as the primary use for me is to keep a printed copy by my side as I raid, so I can easily see the items I am looking out for. Having the xml file aslo save as a CSV file would also work.\n \n2. I would like to see a couple of extra columns on the upgrade list report, that can be added in to the sort sequence. The first would relate to where the item could be found, ie ICC10, TOC25, TOC10H etc, and the second new column would relate to the boss (or trash) the item drops from, ie Lord Marrowgar, Putricide etc. The reason being, I would then have an easily created list that after a boss kill I can coonsukt to eaily see if the dropped item is good for me. Obviously other things get taken into a count, but I still feel a list like this would be very useful.",

      "Message": "Not exactly sure what feature you are asking for since both things are currently available. Both the Direct Upgrade List and the optimize-built Upgrade list can be exported to CSV files as well as being copied to clipboard. Personally I use the clipboard and paste into an Excel spreadsheet which can then be printed (addressing first issue). I then use commas as the delimiter to transform \"text into columns,\" one of these columns being a Source column. While the source contains both who and where the item drops in one spot, it does address your second request. If you know ahead of time which raid you are planning on running using the appropriate filters to select just that one area should give you a short and concise list.\r\n",
