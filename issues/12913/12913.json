I also try to install mono and Rawr on my iMac and MacBook but the result are the same.\r\n\r\nI also try to force mono to use X11 instead of the quartz environnement i think but the new issue was that mono couldn't find the lib gtk for X11.\r\n\r\nI'm french so i also try to change the format into American in case of a number problem but I've got the same error.\r\n\r\nCan you give me a which version of rawar and Mono have you install (and worked) and which version of OS X are you using ?\r\n\r\nThank you",
