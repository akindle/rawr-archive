    "Description": "in rawr 2.3.8 and below the Spyglass is listed as a very low trinket.  even worst then the titan-forged rune of audacity.  (111 sp) however the spyglass is 131 crit and 180 sp.   if you look at the proc  \"Item - Icecrown 10 Normal Caster Trinket \nEach time you deal spell damage to an opponent, you gain 18 spell power for the next 10 sec, stacking up to 10 times.\"   There is no ICD on this trinket.  everytime damage is done it refreshes.  does not matter for dot or direct damage.  Most fights I have 99.9%+ uptime on this proc.  Which would make it much higher on the dps factor.  \n \n \nThanks",
