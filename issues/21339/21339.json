    "Description": "The ProtPala model doesn't seem to be calculating Dodge and Parry and Block correctly as it is not matching the listed Armory Values.\n \nUsing http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/malfurion/Rexea/simple as sample gear set:\n         Armory  -> RAWR\nDodge: 14.26% -> 14.1472%\nParry: 14.95% -> 14.3484%\nBlock: 66.54% -> 65.9367%\n \nAs you can see its as much as 0.6% off (which is a lot when you are talking about block capping!)\n \nCan somebody look into this please?",

Hence the 0.6% difference. Dodge differs a little because of the way Windwalk enchant is calculated, you can just \"remove\" the enchant in Rawr to see your real dodge chance.",
