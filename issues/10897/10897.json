    "Description": "I am trying to run Rawr on Windows XP x64 and am getting errors before I can get in the program. I have the x64 versions of ,NET installed. Here is the message I'm getting:\n \nSystem.Security.SecurityException was unhandled\nMessage: Request for the permission of type 'System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed.\n \nI have other .NET apps working such as Paint.NET and the Wowaceupdater. Is this a Rawr issue or Windows XP x64 issue?",
