Please note armoury issue will have meant that you may have items - typically T9 head piece that has no socket bonus in Rawr. Use the Edit item feature to correct this issue, as it is not a EnhSim export issue but an item issue.\r\n\r\n",

Your AP and Agility both look correct for the procs I can see on your character\r\n\r\n\n\n** Closed by Jothay 12/14/2009 10:07 AM",
