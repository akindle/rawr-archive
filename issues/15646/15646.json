    "Description": "Hello, \n \nLoad from Armory is very intuitive and easy.   I am stumped on the \"Load from Charatcter Profiler\" process.  The process: File >Load from Character Profiler>\"Look in dialogue box appears\".   I don't know where to look.  I have searched the site and had no luck finding instructions.  See screen shot in attached.   Your help is most appreciated.\n \nVery nice application = when I get a job I will be sure to donate.",
