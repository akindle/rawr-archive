    "Description": "The selected enchant name text shown at the bottom of each of the inventory buttons is often pushed up and is chopped by the icon above it. (See attached image)\nI would suggest enlarging these buttons to allow for two-line enchant names below the icon OR making the enchant name font much smaller to let it all fit on one line.",
