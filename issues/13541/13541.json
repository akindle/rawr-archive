Significantly reduced window for multi-threaded problems.  There's still the occasional glitch, but much better than it was.\r\n\r\nFix for def: 13530 - Optimizer glitches from Expertise.  the real probablems were w/ the multi-threaded safety and that's gone now.\r\n\r\nPseudo-Fix for def 13528 - Values suddenly changed.  Values are still changing, but should be more reasonable now.\r\n----\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/CalculationOptionsPanelTankDK.Designer.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/CalculationOptionsPanelTankDK.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/CalculationsTankDK.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/CharacterCalculationsTankDK.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/CombatTable.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/Readme.TankDK.txt\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/RotationViewer.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/ShotRotation.cs\r\nModified : /Rawr.TankDK/StatsSpecialEffects.cs\r\n\r\n",
