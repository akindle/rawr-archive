If you use your Search Box and put in \"ItemSource.xml\" that should tell you the directory where it needs to go. If you see more than one, replace all of them.\r\n7) Go back to the EJ web link for Rawr and it should open now",

The ItemSource.xml file specified is not found in my \"C:\\Users\\<account>\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Silverlight\\is\" folder.\r\n\r\nI have a sneaking suspicion that this is an issue local to me.  Is there some kind of \"master\" Silverlight cache of Rawr3/4 that I can nuke to start fresh?  Silverlight Rawr has been problematic for me from the get-go.",
