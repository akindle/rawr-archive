    "Description": "I just got the trinket from Onyxia, and went to Rawr to figure out how to change up my stats to use it.  However, when I added the trinket and hit optimize, the result was Rawr adding it to BOTH trinket slots.  As the trinket is a quest reward, you can never get two of them.\nÂ \nI have attached the xml file for the character that I was using.",
