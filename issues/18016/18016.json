      "Message": "Also have to add that when the choices are between Spirit/Crit, Spirit/Haste and Haste/Crit,. Normally Haste/Crit'ing all your gear can get you in trouble even as Disc, and that may be why you suddenly sit with a lot of Spirit. Also normally most socket bonuses are worth it for Disc, giving you a lot of Purified gems. But if you are seeing Int/Spi, Pure Spi and Spp/Spi in red, then you probably have not set up options right. Make sure you have all relevant raid buffs and the rest of the options match up to how you expect to play.",

The auto is tank healing with flash heal, but if all/most you're doing is shield spamming, the results will be confusing to novice users (I had this problem myself until I went back and used Rawr 2).\r\n\r\nMany thanks for all the hard work!",
