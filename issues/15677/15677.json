    "Description": "I've imported my character from the armory and the enchant comparisons are showing some strange values for the enchants currently on my gear, showing negative values for some of them. For example - ranking frosthide leg armor (55stam, 22agi) lower than Jormungar Leg Armor (45stam, 15agi), and lower than the profession specific Jormungar Leg Reinforcements, even though they have the exact same stat values! Other examples include giving My expertise enchant on my bracers a negative overall value! This occurs no matter what buffs I have selected, although the values change when I switch buffs around they're still obviously incorrect. Is this an issue with me or is this a known bug with the new version of Rawr? I've included a screenshot to illustrate the problem.",

      "Message": "After deleting and reinstalling rawr and playing around a bit, I've discovered that rawr seems to rank my enchants correctly, UNTIL I go into the buffs tab and start changing what buffs I have available to me.\r\nFor example, on first load, Rawr ranked Arcanum of the Stalwart Protector (20 def rating, 37stam) as the top enchant, which is most likely correct. Then I clicked over to the buffs tab and disabled a buff (Strength of Earth totem) and the Arcanum dropped to the bottom of my head enchant list. Screenshot enclosed. As a side note, re-enabling Strength of Earth totem did not return my enchant list to normal.",
