    "Description": "When using the \"Export Stats to EnhSim config file\" button in the Enhancement Shaman module, it does not export the Proc effect from Black Bruise.\nÂ \nAlso, as a side note, if this does get implemented; please distinguish between the different procs on the 264 and 277 versions of Black Bruise, as the 277 version of the proc does 10% of melee damage as shadow (whereas the 264 version only does 9%)",
