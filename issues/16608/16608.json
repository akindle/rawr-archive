    "Description": "The druid relic/ranged slot item, Idol of Lunar Fury, is showing without its equip bonus (and thus no bonuses at all) in ver. 2.3.11.  While the item still appears in the slot list for balance druids, it has a score of zero as a result.  Refreshing the item data from Wowhead or the Armory has no effect.  The item appeared to be correctly displayed and scored in ver. 2.3.10.",
