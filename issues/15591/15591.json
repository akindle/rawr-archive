    "Description": "Rawr 2.3.4 picks up the two hit trinkets over the Needle-Encrusted Scorpion. I highly doubt that this is correct because the hit is completely wasted for spell hit. It puts me at 4.89% over spell hit cap. But what's even worse, it puts a hit gem in my hat! No one is going to gem for hit while over the hit cap. it could have chosen something with haste which is activated in the gemming templates. (This issue was also present in 2.3.3.)\nÂ \nOptimizing for dps only.",

      "Message": "It isn't gemming for hit in your head item its gemming for expertise, and the most effective way of doing that is a hit/expertise gem. The Needle Encrusted Scorpion is indeed a poor trinket as ArP affects only about half our dps. Hit on the other hand below the melee hit cap is still very very good, as hit translates into extra white damage, higher berserking uptime and more MW5 procs. So why wouldn't it pick a Haste or AP trinket over a ArP one??",
