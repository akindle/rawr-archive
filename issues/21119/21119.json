    "Description": "Since the last update, I have been unable to use the optimizer for arcane mages because the dps portion of the calculations are missing from the formulas.  I've noticed that when I download a filed copy of the information, I have no problem.  It is only when I load a character from battle.net.  I don't see any other mage issue currently open that is addressing this.",
