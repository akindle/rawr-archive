    "Description": "I'm unable to import characters into rawr, both from the addon and from battle.net.  Rawr loads up fine.  When I try to import from the beginning popup window or after I close it the program freezes and becomes unresponsive until I am required to open task manage and shut it down.  I've tried to run Rawr as administrator, and with multiple characters.",

      "Message": "I can track it down even further:\r\n\r\nThe only character i can not load (with the same issues, with the version at EJ as well as with the downloadable one) is my DK, more precisely my TankDK (loads just fine when in Frost Off-spec). To be even more precise: It does not load from any source, not from Battle.net and not from saved files. When creating a new character from scratch to try out where the problem is, I found that it is probably caused by the \"Bone Shield\" Talent. I could assign every talent from the top and when I reached and clicked on \"Bone Shield\" Rawr froze again with 100% CPU usage.",
