    "Description": "Certain buffs, after being enabled in the \"Buffs\" tab, are being cleared when ANY item in the \"Options>Ability Maintenance\" tab is toggled.  The affected buffs are any buff under the Bleed Damage or Physical Vulnerability subsection.\n \nThis only happens on the Arms side of things.  I have not tested if this affected by a certain talent or set of talents or the Arms-Fury selector, but will do when I get a free minute.  Gut tells me that it's the talents relating to the two debuffs/buffs that Arms provides in these two areas.  Armor Debuff (Major) (read: Sunders) are unaffected.\n \nThis is noticed on a local build that includes up to and through 34539.  I have not yet tested an earlier version, though I believe it to be specific to the fixes to Unrelenting Assault included in this specific revision.\n \nCan post Character XML upon request, though I believe that it's easily reproducable and not specific to my version.",
