    "Description": "While trying to run an update from Armory, the Status stalls indefinitely. I run the update, it goes through the 4463 items. Once the \"Update All Items from Armory\" task is at 4462 of 4463, the error panels shows many items that are not in the armory. It is here that the status bar stops at 66%. The last item that shows an error is item 48724. The update does not go into the \"Cache Item Icons\" task. I've had this problem before and I usually just exit out (which wastes the entire process).\nÂ \nI generally run a Wowhead update then an Armory update if that helps.",
