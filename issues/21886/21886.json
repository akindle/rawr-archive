    "Description": "Loading my fire mage, shows my stats completely different to what they are in-game. Now I understand this may be due to it possibly wanting to take into account full raid buffs, but I doubt that. For example it shows my characters' hit at 14.28% when in-game it shows 16.97%. Attached is my character profile.\nÂ \nUsing Rawr WPF 4.3.0",
