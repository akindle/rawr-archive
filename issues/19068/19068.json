    "Description": "Engineers are able to make 359 ilvl helms called Killshades (http://cata.wowhead.com/search?q=Killshades). These do not have any gem sockets, but instead have Cogwheel sockets that only Cogwheel Gems (http://cata.wowhead.com/items=3.10) can be placed. These gems are considered separate from normal gems and should be their own gem type.",
