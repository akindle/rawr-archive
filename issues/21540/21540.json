      "Message": "Just opened the same file in Rawr 4.2.1 and got 66.98% block.  It's closer but still wrong, even though it reports the same mastery amount as 4.2.4.  Someone must have fiddled with the block calculation somewhere between those two versions, but I see no mention of it anywhere in the commits.",

      "Message": "ok so i fixed it by changing the trinket effect to an on use effect.  I was wondering in the future if there would be a way when forcing requirements on the optimize to force the constraint before procs.  This is what im trying to do:\r\n\r\n1. Set requirement for advoidance + block to be >= 100 in optimizer at level 88\r\n2. Set optimize to survivability\r\n3. optimize\r\n\r\nThis way it will optimize my character to be unhittable + have the maximum amount of health possible while being unhittable.  The problem occurs when procs interfere with my unhittable and make it \"unhittable on average\".  if i delete the procs on the trinkets though, I wont get the best trinkets available for that setup, it only looks at the static stat.  I always optimize with no windwalker so that the proc is not included in my optimize",
