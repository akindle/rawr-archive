      "Message": "Also, Lifebloom mana costs are wrong.\r\n\r\nWith 2t7, ToL and OoC it is showing 349.66 = base_mana*14%*ToL*OoC*2t7 = 3496*.14*.8*.94*.95\r\n\r\nHowever, the initial cost is reduced by talents/gear, but the refund is not.  I believe the correct formula for a single lifebloom is\r\n\r\nfloor(floor(base_mana*28%)*ToL*OoC*2t7) - floor(base_mana*14%) =\r\nfloor(floor(3496*.28)*.8*.94*.95)-floor(3496*.14) = 209\r\n",

Is it showing the 44 heal as part of its stats, if not, try reimporting from Wowhead. There is a bug in that it will also have the crit rating, but as far as I know Rawr doesn't allow for an item to have stats that are only applicable in certain forms. Thus either manually edit to be either a tree version or a moonkin version of the Idol. Or don't worry about the extra crit rating too much, if your mostly using rejuv and rolling lifeblooms.\r\nLet me know if you still cannot get the 44 +heal from the Idol.",

      "Message": "Oh, and I went without the floor functions in the formulas, since it seems as if you can sometimes get 1 more mana back, thus I'm assuming this is handled as a fraction and sometimes rounded up or down.",
