    "Description": "I found this because I noticed my boss armor value was set to 11,000 from an old version instead of 10,643.\n \nSteps to recreate:\n - load a cat file\n - go to options tab\n - change boss armor value\n - file save\n - file load the same file\n - it will change back to what it was\n \nIf you change the armor value then change some gear then save, it saves correctly.  Then you can change the gear back and save.",
