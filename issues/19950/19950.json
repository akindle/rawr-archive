    "Description": "This is probably a big PITA to solve, but the Throne of the Four Winds \"random\" enchant items are not in the cache, and require manual adding/editing after each upgrade. After that, they work correctly.\n \nItem example: #63503\n \n(This is probably a minor issue, since it is situational, and the items are far from BiS. However, I don't doubt Blizzard will give us more pieces like this on later tiers)",
