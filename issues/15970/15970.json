    "Description": "I am an elemental shaman (Kanala on Azuremyst US) and I have the item \"Bizuri's Totem of Shattered Ice\" giving me stacking haste on ticks of flame shock.  Total it adds 250 haste (if I am not mistaken), but it shows to add 0.00 DPS with the program.  Is there an issue currently with totems in general or just this item?  It obviously gives more haste than the Totem of Electrifying Wind, so I do not see why it would give 0 instead of +615.71 DPS or more.\n \n**EDIT**\n \nHere is the rundown of this totem.\n \nBizuri's Totem of Shattered Ice\nBinds when picked up - Relic - Totem \nRequires Level 80\nItem Level 264 \nEquip: The periodic damage from your Flame Shock spell grants 44 haste rating for 30 sec.  Stacks up to 5 times.\n\"Counts as an Air, Earth, Fire, and Water totem.\" \n \nThis would add a total of 220 haste for 30 seconds, and if continuing the flame shock to allow for Lava Burst to crit every time, that would basically be a permenant addition to DPS.",
