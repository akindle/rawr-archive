    "Description": "Patch 4.0.6 brought \"stacking\" Blood Shields to the table, and with it Mastery is now much more desirable. The current implementation in Rawr seems to rank it extremely low. At the same time, parry/dodge are ranked lower than they should be (higher than mastery in some cases) and agi/crit are way too high.\nÂ \nI think the stats for TankDK need a total overhaul, and in the meantime I would change it from being \"Mostly\" Cata Ready.",
