    "Description": "When I start Rawr, it just freezes at \"loading\". This is on Windows XP 64 bit, but it used to work, haven't updated anything recently (that I know of). Tried with both the latest stable and the beta, It just freezes after a few seconds, still showing the loading screen (which doesn't get redrawn), doesn't use any CPU, but it doesn't do anything either. I've no idea how to debug stuff on Windows though, heh.",
