    "Description": "(Originally posted in the Discussion area here: http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=70481)\n \nSo I've just started playing around with the Batch Tools.  Like many feral druids, I'm interested in optimally using my gear for tanking and DPS (and different types of tanking set, etc, etc.).  I've been doing it manually up until now, by setting gem and enchanting constraints.\n \nI'm getting some really odd results.  To give a concrete example:\n \n - I have 3 characters in the batch:  Cat, Bear, and Bear_Threat (where the threat selector is set to OT instead of MT).\n \n - I have two relevant pieces of headgear:  Guise of the Midgard Serpent, and Mask of Distant Memory.  They are both available to all 3 characters and have no constraints.\n \nIf I simply use \"Optimize\", the results are as expected.  The Cat chooses Mask, and the Bears choose Guise, with appropriate gems, enchants, etc.  Of course, this doesn't help me as I need a unified set of gems and enchants over all 3 characters.  Moving on:\n \nIf I use \"Batch Optimize\", the Cat still gets Mask and the Bears get Guise.  But for some reason the Mask is using a bear metagem (Austere Earthsiege) instead of Relentless Earthsiege.\n \nThe \"correct\" option is available in the Gear->Head item list.  If I rightclick and Equip it, my Cat score goes up, as you'd expect.  All meta gem requirements are met.  Since this item is not being used for either Bear character, I have manually increased my total score, no matter what the weighting.\n \nWhich begs the question:  Why won't the optimizer make this same choice?\n \n(3 character files and the batch file are attached, though paths may need adjusting).",

      "Message": "Ah.  That's a separate issue.  I actually have two Treacherous Shoulderpads.  There's no reason one can't be gemmed/enchanted for tanking, and one for DPS -- but Batch Optimize obviously can't be informed that there are two physical copies of the item.  Following a suggestion in the discussion area, I copied the item, changed its ID to a fake value, and now the optimizer can deal with it.\r\n\r\nI'd be extremely surprised if that hack were relevant to the reported issue.",

Instead of looking at all the characters it only took the ones from the first character which is bear in you case. As a workaround mark the relentless meta as available explicitly. That should fix the problem.",
