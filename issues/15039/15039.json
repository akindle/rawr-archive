    "Description": "While working on modeling the T10 2-piece for Bears, I realized that the Enrage ability is not fully supported. There is a kind of placeholder on the amount of increased damage from the enraged ability (though this is now slightly out-of-date since 3.2 took out the increased damage outside of KotJ). But it is not calculated into any of the threat, dps, rage, etc calculations. You can test this by putting points in and out of King of the Jungle (which supposedly adds a damage multiplier to the enrage ability). Once this is figured out, one can model the T10 4-piece a bit easier.",
