    "Description": "This seems a bit odd. I loaded my elemental shaman into RAWR, went to the options tab, unselected \"Use Fire Nova\" and selected \"Use DPS Totem\" and my t10 head piece dropped almost to the bottom of the list. At the top of the list are the t10 resto head pieces. Thought maybe it was due to going OOM due to dropping the dps totem more often so I changed fight length to 2 from 5, and that didn't have an effect. Changing those two settings doesn't seem to effect my other gear selections too much, just the locations I have tier. Is the \"Use DPS Totem\" option only showing the gear that would maximize the dps from the totem?",

      "Message": "After I added the 4t10 bonus haste has big spikes in it's graph. This means, that Rawr values certain levels of haste worse than they should be, because it would mess up the optimal timing of Flame Shock and Lava Burst.\r\nEnabling/disabling options like DPS-Totems or Chain Lighting usage shift these spikes around.\r\n\r\nRemember that there is basically no \"evil\" haste value, because you will never be able to play optimally.",
