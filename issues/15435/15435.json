    "Description": "The duration for a double pot trick shows 1 second less duration then the single pot use.  It should be approximately 5-10 seconds (minimum 5 seconds to be able to use a potion again) less then the length of the two potions' durations.\n \n Versions where I've observed the error:  2.2.21, 2.2.24, 2.2.27\n \nSteps to reproduce:\n \nStart Rawr\n \nGo to the Buffs tab\n \nScroll down to the potions area\n \nCheck the 'double pot trick' durations\n \nUsing a single pot will show a duration of x seconds, while double potting shows x-1 seconds.",

      "Message": "Sage things that the duration of the \"Double Pot Trick (Potionname)\" is the total buff duration.  It's not.  That second checkbox is the ADDITIONAL bonus you get -- the first checkbox is for the regular potion.\r\n[_] Potion of Speed (15sec/20min)\r\n.....[_] Potion of Speed (Double Pot Trick) (14sec/20min)\r\n\r\nIn order to check the second one, you must also check the first one.  Checking the first one gives you 500 haste rating for 15secs every 20mins.  Checking the second one ADDS ANOTHER BUFF for 14secs every 20mins.  Net result is 500 haste for 15secs and another 500haste for 14secs, total of 500haste for 29secs.",
