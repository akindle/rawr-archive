    "Description": "In 16.1 (not sure about prior versions), the quiver slot does not have any quivers available.  I manually added the quiver of 1k feathers (item=34105).  It shows up when editting items.  However, it will not go into the character's quiver slot and is not available on the comparison chart.",

      "Message": "Since all of the high end quivers have the same haste effect and there is no way from an armory scrape to tell what kind of quiver a hunter was using, it was hard coded that a hunter would be using a 15% haste quiver.\r\n\r\nThis will probably be added as an option after the module gets updated with all of the new lich king talents and shot rotations as it's not that high of a priority item at the moment.",

      "Message": "I'd say this issue should be closed now that ammo is being able to stack to 1K/soon to be limitless, and quiver haste has been officially added to Auto Shot, leaving quivers in the dust and making general bags better by far.",
