    "Description": "In game i have around 130mp5 while casting due to the 2 talents in the balance and resto tree. RAWR is only taking into account the gear mp5 or enchants which throws off the dps time till oom. Dream state in the balance tree allows you to regenerate mana equal to 10% of your intellect ever 5 seconds while casting, and Intensity from the resto tree allows 30% of your mana regen while casting. Dont know if it is possible to incorperate this into the program or not but I didnt see anyone else bring up this issue.",
