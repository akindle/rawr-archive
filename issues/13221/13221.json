    "Description": "The Potions remaining in code are :\n \n            defaultBuffs.Add(new Buff()\n            {\n                Name = \"Potion of Speed\",\n                Group = \"Potion\",\n                Stats = { HasteRating = 500 },\n            });\n            defaultBuffs.Add(new Buff()\n            {\n                Name = \"Indestructible Potion\",\n                Group = \"Potion\",\n                Stats = { BonusArmor = 3500 },\n            });\n \nBoth give flat boosts which are currently treated as being permanent buffs they should really use the special effects as they are in reality on use items with a limited duration. Speed potion in particular is only 15 seconds and 1 min CD. However since you can only use 1 potion per combat then the CD is really the same as fightDuration. I wasn't entirely confident that I would be coding this right so I decided to raise this as an issue so that Kavan or someone with a better grasp of the coding & pure maths stuff in the SpecialEffect class can fix this issue in the Buff class.",
