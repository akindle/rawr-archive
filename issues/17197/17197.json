    "Description": "For instance, doing an update from wowhead for \"Brilliant Titansteel Helm\" results in a source of \"Crafted\". This is due to this code:\n \n            // Remove Id as we've already processed it\n            json1 = json1.Replace(\"\\\"id\\\":\" + item.Id.ToString() + \",\", \"\");\n            // Remove Name as we've already processed it\n            {\n                //\"name\":\"3Vambraces of the Frost Wyrm Queen\",\n                json1 = json1.Replace(item.Name, \"NAME\");\n                //\"name\":\"3NAME\",\n                int start = json1.IndexOf(\"NAME\") - 9;\n                json1 = json1.Remove(start, \"\\\"name\\\":\\\"3NAME\\\",\".Length);\n            }\n \n \nWhich converts \"Brilliant Titansteel Helm\" in both \"\\\"name\\\":\\\"3Brilliant Titansteel Helm\\\"\" and in \\\"n\\\":\\\"Brilliant Titansteel Helm\\\" (part of sourcemore) with NAME.  Later when trying to determine item location it can't determine one due to a now scrambled sourcemore.",

Again for Brilliant Titansteel Helm, the sourcemore string (after some processing) is \"\\\"c\\\":11,\\\"s\\\":164,\\\"t\\\":6,\\\"ti\\\":55374\".\r\n\r\nWhen the \"c\" key is processed, we set continentname to \"Unknown - 11\".\r\nWhen the \"s\" key is processed, we set itemLocation.skill to \"Blacksmithing\"\r\nWhen the \"t\" key is processed, we replace itemLocation with an empty craftedItem loosing the skill we'd set above.",
