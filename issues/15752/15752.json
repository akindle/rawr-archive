      "Message": "The developer AzP has already statd that demonic pact and other such buffs will be getting added soon. He was getting a lot of pressure to release the module before 100%, which he did. Like all other models with rawr, its a development over time. Warlock model being redone completely puts it back at the infancy stage but he has been making good progress on adding additions/fixes to the module since its initial release.\r\n\r\nAs for entering spell power manually there isn't really a need. Yes the armory may list buffs you have affecting your spellpower, but its my understanding that the modules total up the values on the items and not just read what the armory says it is. Meaning the buffs don't matter that are being displayed on the armory. ",

      "Message": "I wasn't specifically talking about the warlock model itself. More so the other classes that would benefit from this buff. Allowing us to import a warlocks profile specifically for the buff would allow Rawr to know exactly the uptime and bonus spell power of the buff. For example, people optimizing their mage with this program could simply check Demonic Pact under buff and either set the spellpower of the warlock they usually run with or import the warlocks data (armory or saved character profile) to only be used for the buff. This is something that could easily be implemented whether the warlock model is done or not.",

      "Message": "Aaah... gotcha...\r\n\r\nWhat he is saying is that this is for OTHER classes that run with a Warlock who uses DEMONIC PACT which is a spell power increase based on the Warlock using DP spellpower.\r\n\r\nSo if DRUID using RAWR is running with a DP Warlock, the ability to check the DP BUFF and enter a variable SP amount would be beneficial.  Because the DP amount changes, depending on WHO the warlock is and how much SP they have.\r\n\r\nIt is independent of the Warlock module, and should not be tagged as a Warlock issue.",
