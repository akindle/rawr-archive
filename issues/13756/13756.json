    "Description": "Using rawr optimizer for my shadow priest, it gives me a result with 500-600 crit raiting, 500-600 haste rating, and around 2800-2900 spell power.  I own all 5 pieces of T8.5, but it is telling me to wear my t7.5 gloves and leggings of the wanton spell caster instead.  This means I don't get my 4 pc set bonus.  It is also telling me to wear deathchill cloak (ilvl 200) over Asimov's drape (ilvl 226).  When I check the relative stat values chart with this gear set up it is giving me, 1 point of haste rating is valued above 1 spell power (which seems to explain why it wants me to wear those inferior pieces... they are loaded with haste even though they have significantly less spell power and other stats).  This all seems very strange to me as I've always heard haste doesn't scale so great with shadow priests since it doesn't affect the global cooldown or any of the instant spells.  Am I just wrong with my opinions on haste for shadow priests or is rawr overvaluing it?  Can anyone explain what is going on?",

      "Message": "So, haste is more valuable than I thought in that it does affect the GCD... but is that why I am seeing the results I'm seeing?  Do I just have so much spell power that the marginal increase of one haste is now better than 1 spell power?\r\n\r\nAnd if haste is so great, I can't see why it wouldn't want me to take the T8 4pc bonus, a 4 sec HUGE haste buff every time I cast Mind Blast.",
