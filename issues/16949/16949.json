    "Description": "When trying to use Rawr for optimizing my hunter, there is not an option to set the minimum hit rating at 263.  This was available in Rawr 2.2.13 but seems to have been removed in 2.3 and now 3.0 beta.  Hit rating is crucial for all DPS classes and should be added to the hunter optimzier.",

      "Message": "No, actually, hit rating doesn't belong in the optimizer. You should be looking for the stat that actually matters, Chance to Miss. That is in the optimizer, and that's what you should use. You should not be caring about hit *rating*. Use \"Chance to Miss <= 0\" if you want to not miss. However, keep in mind that making that requirement is quite possibly *lowering* your DPS. If you want to optimize your DPS, just do that, optimize your DPS. The ideal amount of hit will be found, which may not be hit capped.",
