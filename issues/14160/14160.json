    "Description": "The current Moonkin model is incorrectly recommending you not use insect swarm claiming it is a DPS loss even when it is Glyphed.  If need be, I can provide a sample xml file.\n \nThe spreadsheet models say that insect swarm is a DPS gain.\n \nThere is some discussion of this on pages 81 & 82 of the http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t37039-moonkin_raiding/p82/ including one persons analysis of how it is being incorrectly calculated.",
