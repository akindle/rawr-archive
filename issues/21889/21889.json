    "Description": "Hey, I just checked Rawr to optimize my reforging, and noticed that the default imported Flickering Shoulderpads are the ones without stats, and not the ones I actually have(Fireflash, haste/crit, 378), and even if I choose the correct ones, the optimizer recommends using T11 shoulders, even though it wouldn't get me any setbonus(and would dump my haste down by about 120). Attached a textfile with my Rawr string from the ingame addon.\n \nEDIT: This is with the thoroughness mover at max, but without holding CTRL and calculating overall DPS, if that helps at all.\n \nAnother thing I noticed was that crit was rated slightly higher than mastery, which might be because it simulates a singletarget Patchwerk fight, where crit increases the amount of VPLC proccs I get.",

    {
      "Message": "This is an optimizer bug, I think, because if you look at the gear list after optimization, it shows the other shoulders far above the ones that the optimizer equips.  Also, you are correct, crit is showing higher because it increases the VPLC proc rate.  The two stats are nearly equivalent in any case, so it's not like you have to go overboard restacking to crit because Rawr told you to.",
