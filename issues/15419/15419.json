When selecting the \"Load Character from Armory\" or \"Open\" and trying to get my character to load I'm not seeing anything. It looks as though it's loading but I just end up with the blank default layout you see when you initially start the application.",

Interesting if supply a wrong server name, the program hangs... so at least it appears as if it trying to contact the wowarmory.  I am on a Mac using Safari.",
