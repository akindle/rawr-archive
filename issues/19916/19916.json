If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Error Message ==\nXML belgesinde bir hata var (1, 1363).\nÖrnek doğrulama hatası: '', Profession için geçerli bir değer değil.\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   konum: System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize(XmlReader xmlReader, String encodingStyle, XmlDeserializationEvents events)\n   konum: System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize(TextReader textReader)\n   konum: Rawr.Character.LoadFromXml(String xml)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\nIt's in turkish becaus my windows is turkish i guess and i tried to check for these things but i failed to find any help on google or here.\n \nThere is no suggested fix or anything. What happens is: I open close my bank rawr gets them then i type /rawr export then i go on rawr program and select load from Rawr Addon and copy that thing in-game there. That is what i get after this.\n \nRawr 4.0.18 [r57766].",

Before you fix it on the addon you could just say which input to change for lets say adding 1 skill tailoring so i could just change the data i copy and paste into rawr so it thinks i got 1 skill in tailoring as 2nd proff. (Just saying) I'll just randomly take a proff myself :)",
