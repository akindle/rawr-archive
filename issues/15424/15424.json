    "Description": "Some models have functionality to automatically select one of several buffs and potentially remove existing buffs that are conflicting with the added ones. Also for some buffs that are exclusive, but provide different functionality, some models automatically select the optimum one.\n \nThe buffs panel currently has no support for this and it is unintuitive to the users when they select a buff, but they don't see a change because the buff is overridden by the model.\n \nTo better expose this to the users the following functionality should be implemented:\n \nIf model overrides particular buff without user input disable the check box (gray out) and set Checked depending on model override.\n \nFor options where model chooses the best buff out of an exclusive group provide a way for users to specify not which buffs are selected, but which should be allowed for consideration. Then the model can select the best out of the allowed options. An example would be Potion of Wild Magic and Potion of Speed. If the user selects to allow both, the model selects the best one, but if one is disabled that option would not be considered by the model. Additionally it would be good if there would be some visual indication as to which buff was actually selected by the model.",
