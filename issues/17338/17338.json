    "Description": "After some days I looked at my BiS list for Bears.\nI was wondering that items with armor like the neck \"Bile-Encrusted Medallion\" dropped down very much in the list.\nAnd then i saw it: In 2.3.13 my BiS list had 42444 armor, in 2.3.14 and 2.3.15 the armor is 58528/58550 armor.\nÂ \nIn all three Rawr versions the same file was used.\nI disabled all buffs, but the armor was 55440.",
