      "Message": "So the real issue would be loss of RP from T7.5 isn't accounted for until rotation window is entered and rotation changed, which would lead to the discrepancy in Rawr thinking losing T7.5 bonus for a better single piece of gear is a good choice? ",

      "Message": "Actually, yes.  I didn't even think about that until you mentioned it.\r\n\r\nForcing automated RP management would possibly fix this (the difference between 4pc T7 and not is some number of Death Coils or Frost Strikes per rotation, right?).",

      "Message": "Using my above attached file, using RP Management does result in the DPS change when set bonus is broken/gain. If the optimizer is run, it still breaks the set bonus for a loss in overall DPS, but a gain in DPS before the RP Management is factored in. So potentially a fault of the optimizer.",
