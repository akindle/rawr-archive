    "Description": "Exalted ICC rings not in item cache - not a big deal, I'm sure you'll update the item cache with new bosses and as soon as it goes open beta.\nÂ \nWithout being able to load an old character file or load from Armory/Profiler I went ahead and manually equipped all the gear, talents etc. Optimizer didn't recognize any of the manually equipped stuff. Meh. Back to Mr. Robot.",

      "Message": "Tried to edit in the Exalted ICC rep ring, http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50402\r\nResult was hang fire, spinning beach ball of death. No choice but to Force Quit.\r\n\r\nMousing over items reveal all normal information except what gems are socketed. Which leads to interesting workarounds when trying to figure out what would be best and almost-best gemmings ...you have to select a bunch of gear that you don't have, then Optimize in order to find the names of the gems you should be using. Even more fun was being recommended dual ArPen trinkets + full Agi gemming and then trying to figure out how much of an upgrade that was over leaving quite a lot of gems as ArPen... ugh.\r\n\r\nHere's to hoping Blizz gets off their butt about the armory stuff.\r\n\r\n:)",
