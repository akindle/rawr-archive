    "Description": "I like how the new Optimize feature works but I have to keep switching back to 2.2.4 because that optimizer would give me the NAMES of the gems I need instead of just what their stats are.\n \nIs there any way to include gem names in the tooltip of the optimizer, or simply add them into the \"Copy character Stats to clipboard\" function so I an put them into a text document after I load the optimized changes.\n \nIt's great that I get to see what stats the gems have, but I don't have all the gem names to stats memorized so it takes me quite some time to track them down if I can only see the stats.",
