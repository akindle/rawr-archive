    "Description": "I'd be nice to get a \"pause\" feature for the Optimizer and Build Upgrade List functions. A lot of times I have to cancel the Build Upgrade List, for example, before it's finished because it's running my CPU pretty hard and it chews framerate while I'm engaged in combat. I'd like to be able to just let the optimizer run while I'm doing dailies and out of combat and then pause it if I go into a heroic or start raiding.",
