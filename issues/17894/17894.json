    "Description": "Often I want to find the drops on a specific boss and the next time I want to know all the possible loot in-game. When I need to switch between these two searches, it takes a long time to enable or disable all the filters (e.g. Dungeons, Tier 10 Raids, PvP) because you have to click on all of them. It would be very nice to have a button or something which enables you to turn all the filters on/off with one click.",
