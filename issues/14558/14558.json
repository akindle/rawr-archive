    "Description": "I loaded my priest from the armory, selected 2 items to see if those two items is worth upgrading. When I tried to Optimize though, the new pop-up message that warns of no gems/enchants selected for certain items was giving me this message even though all three items are gemmed/enchanted from the armory. The only thing the three items had in common was that all three had a JC gem in each one.",
