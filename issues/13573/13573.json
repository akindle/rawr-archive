    "Description": "It greys out my 3crit meta on my hat when I check the enforce req box as if it was not satisfied.  \n \nHats with blue gems in them suddenly appear very high with non-grey meta in effect.  The enchanted tear in my chest piece should satisfy the meta by itself :).\n \nEnchanted tear also does not show up on the gem list at all.  Deleteing the enchanted tear and refreshing item 42702 from wowhead only seemed to work.  Maybe the code for pulling gem colors from armory is messed up?",
