      "Message": "Was changeset 42697 supposed to fix this? Looking at the trinkets list after this revision, it looks like trinket special effects aren't being counted at all again. (MP5 + Use:SP trinkets like Energy Siphon are only showing points in Sustained for example.) The proc effects seem to affect the stats in the stats window though. (Broodmother gives 125 SP)\r\n\r\nYou probably know about this already, but I thought I'd mention it anyway. ^^\r\n",

      "Message": "Yep, was just about to add it.  The proc now has some value, but it's only correctly being applied to Healing Stream Totem.  It's taking a good bit of work to fix, but is worth it as it should clean up the rest of the calculations a bit more.",
