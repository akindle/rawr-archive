    "Description": "I know there isn't a dedicated hunter developer and that Jothay has been doing a really good job keeping the Rawr2 hunter module up and running but the Rawr3 module is almost useless for hunters. To start there is no rotation setup for any spec, this causes all of our special attacks to be \"not in rotation\" and the only calculated DPS as being autoshot. Fresh load straight from armoury also fails to load any ammo so module assumes basic arrows and on the projectile gear list, the \"best\" arrows that can be equipped are terrorshaft arrows (46.5dps) which is nearly half of end game iceblade arrows (91.5). Currently the only way for Rawr3 to be useful for hunters is to use Rawr2, then save the file, and then open it up in Rawr3 (which lacks the Pet Buffs and other tweaks) which might be useful for people going between Window and Mac OS machines but is a waste of time for the rest of us.\nRawr3 DPS - Hunter 971.60, Pet 188.52; Total 1160.12\nRawr2 DPS - Hunter 4169.42 Pet 416.50 Total 4585.92\nRawr3 (imported from Rawr2) - Hunter 4169.86 Pet 350.85 Total 4520.71",
