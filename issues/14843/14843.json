    "Description": "It was noted on the EJ forums...\n \n\"The hyperaccelerators and pyro-rocket glove enchants put a 10 second cooldown on activated trinkets. This decreases those types of trinkets uptimes slightly and normally ends up making them a bit worse then expected. Looking at the list of recommended upgrades it doesn't seem like Rawr is taking that into account.\"\n \nDo we have a means of modifying trinket uptimes if these enchants are used?",
