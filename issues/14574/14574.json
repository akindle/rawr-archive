    "Description": "As the title says, ever since I've downloaded the latest patch, v2.2.24 any time I do anything in Rawr it takes a long time and drives both my cores to 100% usage.  This includes changing the graph from different slots, clicking on a piece of equipment to change to something else, anything.  The little spinning wheel comes out, it cranks away and eventually returns successfully (hasn't actually crashed yet).  Its basically making the thing unusable.\n \nAnyone else experiencing this problem?",

However, now that you've pointed it out I've gone back, removed the point in Mark of Blood and retested and everything seems back to normal.  I've also tested my dps spec and that doesn't seem to have the problem.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this certainly seems to be a duplicate.",
