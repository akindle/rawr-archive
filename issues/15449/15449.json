    "Description": "As soon as ICC Filters are in I plan to always keep Direct Upgrades open on my 2. screen for each boss I'm currently fighting.\n \nThe only problem I see with Direct Upgrades is that it compares 1H vs. 2H as opposed to 1H+Offhand vs 2H. (Not sure how it handles meta gem requirements, but the 1H vs 2H bugs me a little atm.)\n \nAny chance you'd change the way this works?",
