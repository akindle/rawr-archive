    "Description": "Rawr Models Spellpower as \"HPS - Sustained\"\n \nThis is an archaic model from BC and Classic, which's logic worked as follows:\n \n1) Spellpower means that I heal more per heal\n2) Therefore I need to cast less heals\n3) Therefore I use less mana.\n \nErgo, Spellpower is effective at making my mana last longer.\n \nIn today's modern healing environment, healers are never missing a Global Cooldown, and reactive healing is all but dead.\nThis has several implications.\n1) Overhealing is mostly irrelevant\n2) You never cast less healing spells because you are *always* casting.\n \n2) Spellpower has it's weight greatly skewed when it's treated as a hybrid \"Burst\" and \"Sustainability\" Stat.\n \nThe only time spirit, mp5 and intellect (\"Regen\" stats) Are treated as useful is when there is a difference between \nHPS Sustained and HPS burst, Because spellpower increases both equally, it's useless for compensating for any deficit between HPS Burst and HPS Sustained.\n \nThis would provide a much better means of evaluating gear in terms of it's impact on regeneration, especially with discipline's current obsession with spellpower.",
