    "Description": "The add-on \"Sanity2\" and \"SanityItemCache\" provide information as to what is in a character's bags, and is available offline! If Rawr would parse this the WTF/Account/(account-name)/SavedVariables/SanityItemCache.lua file, it would be able to tell what items were in my bags and bank.\n \nSimilarly, there are other \"bag\" add-ons which store bag information (Altoholic does this the same as SanityItemCache does).\n \nFor example, SanityItemCache.lua has:\n  ...\n[\"Mycharacternamehere\"] = {\n  [\"Bags\"] = {\n    {     \n      { 1, 1, \"item:41133:0:0:0:0:0:0:40197184\", 1, 1, },\n      { 20, 1, \"item:33470:0:0:0:0:0:0:283556236\", 0, 2, },\n      ...\n \nwhere Altoholic.lua looks more like:\n[\"Mycharacternamehere\"] = {\n  [\"inventory\"] = {                                         \n    \"|cffa335ee|Hitem:39514:3816:3627:3448:0:0:0:0:80|h[Heroes' Crown of Faith]|h|r\",\n    45116,\n    \"|cffa335ee|Hitem:40450:3806:3455:0:0:0:0:0:80|h[Valorous Shoulderpads of Faith]|h|r\",\n    41253,\n    \"|cffa335ee|Hitem:40381:3252:3459:3455:0:0:0:-1636729984:80|h[Sympathy]|h|r\",\n    ...\n \n \nSo the necessary programing would require:\n 1) Being able to parse a various LUA files that setup variables.\n 2) Parse several add-on bag tracker saved-variable formats, like Sanity2/SanityItemCache and Altoholic.\n 3) Be able to map WTF/Account/XXXX directories to characters. Sounds not too difficult, given the realm and char name is already saved.",

      "Message": "Great idea, but not suitable for the official version of Rawr due to exactly what Jothay said. However, I'd dearly love to see this via a workaround like the addons producing one or more of the following:\r\n* a simple text list of item names sorted by slot, sorted alphabetically\r\n* a file importable into Rawr\r\n* a standard Rawr character file\r\n* an addon or mod for Rawr - though I'm guessing this would be hugely problematic due to the ever-changing nature of Rawr\r\n\r\nSome of the above functionality should already be present (please excuse my technologically challenged n00bishness) ...maybe, I have never messed with any character profiler stuff.\r\n\r\ncheers",

However, my understanding is that CP is no longer supported.\r\n\r\nIt's easy enough to import a file if the user knows where it is (IMO, this is safer than mapping to a directory for the reason Jothay mentioned).  The difficult part is deciding what to support.  We need to pick an addon to recommend, and as it stands we're still in a DVD+R/DVD-R/BlueRay/VHS/Mono situation where there are a few options and nobody's a clear winner yet.",
