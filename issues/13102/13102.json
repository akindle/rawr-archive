    "Description": "When I try to optimize my tanking stuff with ProtPaladin, I got strange result.\n \nI put 1 condition that is \"% Chance to be Crit\" <= 0\n \nThe result is that :\n%Chance to be crit = 0\nDefense : 539 ( Defense Rating 685).\n \nOr with this value of Defense Rating I'm criticable. \nWe need 689 defense rating to be non criticable.\n \nI attache my xml file for you to test. Just do an optimization.",
