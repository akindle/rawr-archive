    "Description": "This is related to an earlier Discussion post, my apologies for not making it an Issue instead (wasn't sure it was a bug, but now I understand you want to err on the side of using the Issue Tracker if its close.)\n \nFor some combinations, I was seeing gems switching back and forth on consecutive Optimize runs. At present, I'm NOT seeing that, but then the Armory is down so I'm not using my absolute latest gear.\n \nWhat I has seeing is that the optimizer has a better optimal rotation than the character, even after loading the results of the previous run. I think that in some situations this could cause the gear to bounce around.\n \nEvery stat is the same, but the optimizer gets better Optimal Rotation DPS.",
