    "Description": "The Optimizer is a little off when handling prismatic gems and socket bonuses. Attached is my Tankadin that I just optimized for Overall with Chance to be Crit = 0%, Chance to be Hit = 0%, Avoidance >= 50%.\n \nThe problem is on the Chest, and Neck or Shoulders. Both the neck/shoulders have a 41 stam jewelcrafter's gem in them, with a socket bonus of 6 stam. The chest has 2 normal gems, but they don't match the req for the bonus, which is 9 stam. However, if you were to move 1 Prismatic gem from either the neck/shoulders to the red slot on the chest, move the 12stam/8 dodge gem to the blue slot on the chest, and move the 24 stam gem to wherever the prismatic came from, you'd gain 3 stam net from the socket bonus and not lose any of the original gems.\n \nThis is a minor issue, but thought I'd bring it up anyway...",
