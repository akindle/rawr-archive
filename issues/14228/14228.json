    "Description": "In both 2.2.18 and 19, you don't appear to be able to manually add an item that has a higher ilvl item in the database. For example, in 2.2.19 I can see the ilvl258 version of the band of callous aggression but not the ilvl245. I went to wowhead to get the item number, manually added it, but it still doesn't show up in my list of available upgrades.\nÂ \nThanks for all the work on this project!",

      "Message": "Due to the new filters in 2.2.18/2.2.19, items are (attempting to be) filtered based on their locations. Problem is that a good deal of items in the itemcache file don't have the proper drop locations, many items are truncated with locations such as \"Found in Champions' Cache in\", leaving off the actual location, which messes with the filters. Refreshing data from Armory seems to fix this problem for most items.",

We do not manually go back through and try to update items that *may* be sitting with bad location data and updating them from Armory, there are just too many items in the cache for us to sit and do them all. We leave it to you, the users, to update your own cache files since it's an easy process on your end, and you have the free time.",
