    "Description": "Could we with vision impairment please have control of text size? The Windows magnifier is too cluttered to read, understand, and implement RAWR for me (at least). My kids gave me a MS magnifying mouse, but it too is cumbersome to \"work\" a spreadsheet.\n \nIf I could (preferably) have text resizing similar to Firefox, I'd really be happy.\n \nAt least 3 to 4 \"pica\" size increases, please. I can control the dox and readme easily, but the RAWR panes are just too small to be comfortable and to work for extended periods.\n \nThanks very much.",
