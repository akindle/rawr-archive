    "Description": "It's not a mistake or a bug,\nbut the comparison is bad between an enchanted One-Hand + Off-Hand\nand a Two-Hand Weapon.\ne.g. Druid:\nThe enchant for one Hand ist +63 spell power.\nYou will see that a lot of one-hand weapons (+ chosen off hand) are better than several two hand weapons.\nWhy?\nThe tool does not compare between two enchanted weapons. It compares the enchanted one hand + off hand\nwith the un-enchanted tow hand.\nIt changes completely when you choose two hand weapon with the +83 spell power enchant.\nThe two-hand weapon will be now much stronger than several one hand (+ off hand [which is currently deactivated])\nÂ \nThe tool should compare both (one-hand + off-hand) and (two hand) with best enchants!",
