    "Description": "There are quite a few issues with the 2.3.9 release for Rogues. For combat, when you change anything in the options box as far as rotation, or custom rotation, it does not change anything, changing poisons, combo point generation ability, finisher, and custom rotation check marks. Second, as has been mentioned, for combat weapon speed for MH does not seem to be correctly calculated, and it also seems that off hand weapons that would proc hack and slash (for swords and axes) is not being calculated either. Also for combat, which is probably a result of the options tab not functioning properly, is that it automatically considers you use envenom instead of eviscerate, even when eviscerate is chosen in the options tab. Stat values (as stated already) seem to be a bit off as well.",
