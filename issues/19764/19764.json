    "Description": "I receive an error when selecting the Reset button in the Filter Items by Source window. Also, there are no listed sorts by default.\n \nEdit. I fail at using the reporting template. I was using the most current release 4.16, via Chrome.\n \nI have performed the Suggested Fix and continue to receive this error. If I am posting this message without having performed the Suggested Fix I am aware that I am consuming the Developer(s) time in managing my Issue unnecessarily.\n \n== Error Message ==\n[NoElements]\nArguments: \nDebugging resource strings are unavailable. Often the key and arguments provide sufficient information to diagnose the problem. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=106663&Version=4.0.51204.0&File=System.Core.dll&Key=NoElements\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.Last[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source)\n   at Rawr.UI.GraphDisplay.SourceFilters_Helper(Boolean Checked, Boolean Reset)\n   at Rawr.UI.GraphDisplay.BT_SourceFilters_Reset_Click(Object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.OnClick()\n   at System.Windows.Controls.Button.OnClick()\n   at System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.OnMouseLeftButtonUp(MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.Control.OnMouseLeftButtonUp(Control ctrl, EventArgs e)\n   at MS.Internal.JoltHelper.FireEvent(IntPtr unmanagedObj, IntPtr unmanagedObjArgs, Int32 argsTypeIndex, Int32 actualArgsTypeIndex, String eventName)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\nThere were no suggested fixes. I have forced a reload in the browser as well as trying Chrome, Firefox and IE.\n \nTo create the problem, I went to http://elitistjersks.com/rawr.php and did not load a model. I selected Filters, then the Filters by Source and selected Reset to see if that would populate the list witht he default sorts. At this point, I received the error.\n \nusing the latest web release, which I believe is 4.16.",
