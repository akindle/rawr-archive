    "Description": "2 things I have found.  When setting up the ISB uptime for raid shadow users, the shadow priest section is actually labelled \"Warlocks\".  Nothing major, but thought it was worth pointing out.\nÂ \nMore importantly, when I ran the optimizer it apparently doesnt consider any enchants when choosing gear.  If I did not select any enchants (by putting a diamond aside of them) will the optimizer simply not choose any?  If thats the case, then its my error, otherwise when I ran the optimizer, it selected gear appropriately and it got me to 16% hit, but none of my gear was enchanted, once I added the head enchant, I could upgrade some items to get a higher DPS and still remain hit capped.  Im thinking I just screwed up the enchant set up though.",
