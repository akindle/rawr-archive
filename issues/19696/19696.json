I&#39;d rather have it work slowly but correctly so I&#39;m working on the model first.Some tips though&#58;&#42; If you know your rotation, then set it as custom and enable &#39;don&#39;t optimize rotation&#39;. This will prevent the model from trying every possible rotation every time something is calculated.&#42; If you don&#39;t know your exact rotation but do do know parts of it then set those parts at least &#40;for example turning off SS and Evis for Assassination Rogue, RS and Hemo don&#39;t matter as you won&#39;t have the talent anyway&#41;.&#42; If you don&#39;t have to provide the armor debuff make sure you turn on the buff the other person is giving, otherwise the model will turn on Expose Armor calcs.",

    "Description": "Description: Rawr runs extremely slow, almost to the point that it seems to lock up. It takes two or three minutes to change an item. \n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Import a Rogue from game with addon, or from armory\n2) Load Rawr on EJ or stand-alone either one\n \nObservations:\n1) It takes a long time to populate\n2) Changing an item, gem, chant. Takes a serious long time.\n3) Will not Optimize, even after you are patient waiting on the above.\n \nAdditional Information: \nRawr 4.0.15 Beta\nWindows 7 and XP-3\n \nI am basing the speed off of the fact that I can manipulate items, gems, optimize, etc. On my Mage without any slowness. It is almost instant. Closer to the old WOLK Rawr.",
