    "Description": "Difference between Armory data and data showing in Rawr with Health and Armor totals. My current armory and in game stats for my warrior shows 37846hp and 29098 armor, while in Rawr the \"unbuffed\" numbers are off. Rawr shows 37206 HP and 30239 armor (level 83 target selected). Even more changing the targets level in the options tab to a lower level changes the armor total on the stats tab while unbuffed and buffed. Also the total amount of stamina is also showing a difference between armory/in game and rawr. This information I believe can effect the buffed number for reduction % since while selecting buffs I have in a 10man raid between ingame and rawr are different. Information for said warrior is listed in the steps to recreate this issue. \n \n   1. Launch Rawr\n   2. File > Load from armory... \n   3.
