      "Message": "To view bug. Load the XML file and scroll down to Insect Swarm dps report figure. Note that the figure is NaN and the tootip shows 0.00 avg hit and 0 avg mana. \r\n\r\nI'm aware that my character is a work in progress and is not Raid hit capped, largely because I've not raided with him yet. The plan is to get rid of the 200 blues & epics before contemplating a raid by which time he will ofc be raid capped.",

It's not like the internal calculations are going to bug out.\r\n\r\nI should add that while I am going to fix it, it's actually been in there for a while; I've seen it before and have just been too lazy to get around to it.",
