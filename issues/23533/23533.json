    "Description": "After optimising, I try to build an upgrade list, it usually gets to around 28-32% before stopping and giving the error message attached.  It doesn't freeze, the green bars are still moving and all that, it just stops the process. I can't click the pause or cancel buttons after closing the error window, it's like the buttons aren't programmed to do anything, I have to hit the X in the corner to get back to my character.",
