If it does, that seems like something that should be in the buffs list for other healers in case their raid contains a resto Druid, though I've not seen it in the list.",

I want to say I remember the buff saying \"from the Druid\" too, but I don't remember if that was in BC or early Wrath. Might have been changed with the 3.0 buff consolidations.\r\n\r\nI'll test it tonight with my Resto Druid buddy. I'll drop 50 heals on myself with and without the tree aura present and see if there's a difference (6% should be noticeable, right?). I'll report back later tonight.",
