    "Description": "1. The relative stat valuations for my warrior greatly overvalue stamina with my current gear. Slightly adjusting my stamina up OR down brings the value back in line with the other ratings. \n \n2. The stat valuation for Strength is incorrect. STR has two effects for warriors: melee attack power and Block value. Adding Strength adds Block Value (one per two)  and Attack Power (two per one). \nIn the RAWR valuation, Strength is valued at 1.05 Threat, Block Value is valued at 0.88 Mitigation & 0.89 Threat (1.76 total), and Attack Power is valued at 0.70 Threat.\nSo the value of 1 Strength should be at least as great as (2*AP + 0.5*BV). (0.44 Mit + 1.845 Th) Naturally it would be even higher, due to Vitality, Kings...\n \nRepro steps:\nLoad US/Ravenholdt/Makhand into Rawr v2.3.20. \nUnder comparisons, slot:, change Gear>Head to Relative Stat Values.\nObserve values of Strength vs. Block Value and Attack Power.\nObserve Stamina is valued at 6.85 points, while Agility is 3.94 and Parry Rating is 3.72.\nChange the Chest enchant from nothing (oops :) ) to Heavy Borean Armor Kit. \nObserve Stamina is valued at 3.42 points, while Agility is 3.94 and Parry Rating is 3.72.\nChange the Chest enchant from the kit back to nothing. \nStamina returns to 6.85 points.\nChange the Head enchant from Arcanum of the Stalwart Protector to nothing. \nObserve Stamina is valued at 3.42 points, while Agility is 3.95 and Parry Rating is 3.73.",
