    "Description": "In the stats section when you have either kings or mongoose selected you can get a multiple decimal point agility number such as 182.3124.\nIn the case of mongoose I'm not sure that the buff should show in the stats section (using it in the calc for agility is a given, for mitigation I'm divided, it's not something you can count on for mitigation really) in the case of kings it should be floored before shown.",
