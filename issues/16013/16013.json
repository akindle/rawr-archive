    "Description": "The cycle analyzer takes exceptionally long to run, every 100 increment takes ~4 seconds on a i7-920 -- when last run on this system several revisions ago, I seem to remember it running much faster.\n \nAlso, as you can see by the screenshot, the status line at the bottom shows x/-808182895 after a few calculations, and remains steady at that large negative number until canceled.\n \nThis bug is in 2.3.6 and 2.3.5 that I still have installed at the moment.",

      "Message": "When you last run it you most likely had different gear. Specifically 2T10 bonus makes a significant difference. It's not advised to run the optimal cycle solver in this situation. What you should do is to select from the drop down in the cycle analyzer the one without ABar or one before that, that is the only one that is feasible with 2T10. The first one is only feasible for manual testing, not automated optimum search.",
