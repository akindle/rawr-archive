    "Description": "Using character profiler, I imported my druid into both the released version of Rawr 2.1.4 and also a compiled build of 29593.  Release version shows my armor at 35631.82, and the compiled version shows me at 58226.86.  As excited as I would be to be 8k armor over cap (presumably following the patch), I can't help but think something is wrong in the calculations.  Attached is my CharacterProfiler.lua.",
