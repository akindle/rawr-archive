    "Description": "This problem is not specific to Rawr, but is a result of the entire EJ website being set to a forced display width.  While it looks great for the forums, it's doing bad things to Rawr.  Attached is a screenshot showing an example of the issues.  The right pane bars are all scrunched, and the scaling numbers at the top are all squished together.  The dropdown \"Find\" box is clipped.\n \nThe most irritating issue, not shown in that screen shot, is the mouseover tooltips in the right pane.  They flicker badly as you mouse over things, and sometimes it's hard to find the \"sweet spot\" where right-clicking will bring up the context menu.\n \nI was unable to find a place to question this on the actual EJ forums, but hopefully you've got an in with them so this can be worked out.",
