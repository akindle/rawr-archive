    "Description": "As of 2.3.8 Rawr's set bonuses from Buffs.cs seem to include only retribution set bonus.\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=899 \n \n* 2 pieces: While your Divine Illumination talent is active, your healing spells are 35% stronger. http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=70755\n* 4 pieces: Your Holy Shock spell causes the next Holy Light you cast within 10 sec to have 0.3 sec reduced cast time.  http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=70756\n \nseem to be missing.\nI'm sure this will change soon, but i wanted to push it a little.\n \nOn related off topic note, how is the t9 set bonus called on the buf fpage? i cant find a triumphant 2/4 piece of Triumphant Garb",

And our 4 piece T10 bonus suck for Holy Light play style. (And Rawr currently doesn't support Flash of Light play style.) So it's not a major problem I think. Maybe I'll have a look at it after I'm finished with Retribution...",
