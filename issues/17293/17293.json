    "Description": "I'm wondering if dodge is rated incorrectly or at least why it is so highly for TankDKs.\n \nIn both rawr3 beta and 2.3.14, when I load my character from the armory (EonarUS, Xaris) I look at the gear comparisons for waist.  My DK has the Verdigris Chain Belt, socketed with 2 x Solid Dragon's Eye and 1 x Solid Majestic Zircon.  So, 2 x 51 STA gems and 1 30 STA gem.   However, when looking at the gear comparisons - Rawr is claiming that the Verdigris Chain Belt is better with a 15stam/10dodge gem and 2 x 30 STA gems.\n \nSo in other words, Rawr is saying that 75 stamina & 10 dodge is quite a bit better for survival & mitigation than 132 stamina.\n \nIs this correct and if so why?",

Be sure to have the Jewelcrafter cuts enabled in the gemming templates and just to make sure, in the filters as well.  \r\nAnd yes, there are times that Dodge > Stam.  Esp if it's trying to match a socket bonus, or support a meta, either of which can be the case here:\r\n24 Stam + 10 Dodge Rating is certainly greater in most cases than raw 30 Stam.",
