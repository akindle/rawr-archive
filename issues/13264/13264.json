    "Description": "I recently downloaded .2.2.4 and tried to open my character files. Rawr claims that they are saved with an old incompatible version of rawr.\nNormally this can be bypassed if you open the file in the older version you used before, but even 2.2.3 gives the same warning.\nÂ \nI didnt hit \"save\" in either version on this file, so im puzzled.\nWhy doesnt rawr want to load these files?\nAnd how can i make rawr do so without recalculating the whole thing ? ;)",
