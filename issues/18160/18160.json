    "Description": "I know we're all about getting the biggest and best-est numbers here for the sake of being, well, the best...but I'd like to see an option that forces Rawr to only gem up gear that unlocks the gear bonus (if applicable).  Of course these gems would work off of the gemming templates...I just think there's not much point in having the templates for, say, my DK Tank, when everytime all I ever get from the Optimizer is Solid Majestic Zircon in every slot.\nÂ \nAnd before Astrylian comes in screaming about \"but that's how Rawr works, gear bonuses are crap, etc. etc.\", yes, I know all this already...I'm still asking for the feature :P",

If you need a certain amount of survivability, add that in as an optimizable stat.  If you need a certain amount of mana longevity, add that in as an optimizable stat.  Choosing an option to match all socket bonuses goes against the entire point of the program, and it's not something that we will support.  If it's best for you to pick up a given socket bonus, the model will.  If not, it won't.\r\n\r\nIf you're getting Solid Majestic Zircon in every slot, that's because it's best for you, /given the fight characteristics that you input/.  Rawr will only be as accurate as the variables you give it.",
