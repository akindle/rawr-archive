I have to either change the custom gems as that of using JC gems, or I have to manually mark the JC gems in the gem listing.",

      "Message": "An awesome idea, although really it depends on how one uses Rawr.  Some models are gem-template driven, and others aren't as much for performance reasons (ie, DPSWarr doesn't have a million gem templates because it's already quite slow and there are tons of options; EnhShaman has like 40 gem templates).\r\n\r\nA possible solution would be to check each item's gems to see if it's in a gem template.  If it's not, mark the individual gem as available (possibly as a yes/no prompt).\r\n\r\nOne thing to note, though, is that you should only have to mark your gems once for your priest.  After you've done it once, save the file, and in subsequent runs you should use the \"Reload character from armory\" option.",

When I went to optimize, said that the Brilliant Dragon's Eye was not selected. Hence my original post.",
