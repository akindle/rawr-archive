    "Description": "I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but a search of the forums didn't turn anything up.  When I optimize my hunter, it has me swapping out the Iceblade arrows for Saronite arrows.  I tried updating my cache for that item, but no dice.  If I look in the regular screen, it shows the Iceblade correctly as the best choice.  Is there a setting I'm missing?  I've attached my file.  If I put this in the incorrrect forum, I apologize in advance!",

The only thing I can think of that might be the cause is the Projectile slot not being properly checked like other slots are for comparisons. Someone with more info on that subject would need to comment.",
