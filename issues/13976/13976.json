    "Description": "This is not exactly an issue or bug, it is more of a suggestion. Sometimes you start doing optimizations that take a long time (Build Upgrade List, for example) and it would be nice to have the option to pause it or at least get a confirmation box after you click the [Cancel] button (which would serve as a pseudo-pause).",

      "Message": "As a workaround in the mean time, you can goto Task Manager, right click on Rawr.exe, and set the Priority to Low. I do that while raiding, and it *effectively* pauses the calculations because it doesn't slow down any other programs (it'll still calculate, slowly, if nothing else is using your CPU).\r\n\r\nBut yeah, a way to programmatically do that, and to outright pause it, is definitely on my list of things to add.",

I don't know how the threads interact with the .NET garbage collector and system background tasks though, so there may be a reason it needs to be 'normal'.",
