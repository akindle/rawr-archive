    "Description": "Every time I try to put different gems into my gear it only have the option of four gems.  I've deleted and redownloaded the program.  I've even deleted my saved toons and remade them after redownloading.  I've checked the filters.  I just don't know what is preventing me from choosing more than four gems.  I'm hoping someone here will know the solution and if so thank you for your answer.",
