    "Description": "When trying to load a saved character profile, Rawr will process the three steps, and crash while I assume it is trying to load the gear the character is wearing. Step three finishes, and the character slots remain blank for a moment before the Windows error appears stating \"Rawr has encountered an error and needs to close.\" This also happens when trying to load a character from the File menu.\nÂ \nThis could very well be a bug for any class/race, but I only have a Night Elf Fury Warrior saved.",
