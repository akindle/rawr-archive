    "Description": "Also deselecting and re-selecting glyphs back to the way they were is producing different dps values. when I click off obliterate, and reclick it, my dps goes up by 6. Then when I select glyph of disease and then deselect it, it goes back down by 6. I can keep reproducing this by doing the same thing over and over again. Also, another strange thing, im dual wield frost, no points in blood, and when i first messed with the blood worms uptime, bring it from the default 25% to 0%, i lost 1 dps, when i returned it to 25% and higher, I did not gain back any dps however.\nÂ \nAlso, the ICC buff does not work correctly in the DK model(it does seem to work correctly for my paladin), but on the DK model it only increases my auto attack, BCB, and necrosis damage. It could perhaps be modeling it as haste instead of damage.",
