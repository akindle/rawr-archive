    "Description": "May be related to : Item #  \t 12421 \"possible \"Set Default Gems for Equipment\" problem\".  I'll let someone else make that call.\n \nLoading a character from armory now marks equipped items as \"available\" for the optimizer.  It also protects all those freshly-marked gemmings from being deleted by \"Set Default Gem Types\".\n \nTo reproduce:\n1) Install a fresh copy of Rawr 2.1.8 (no default gem selections have been made)\n2) Load Kelthion of Nathrezim (US) from Armory\n3) Assign buffs (optional) in order to make gem-ratings more accurate\n4) Open \"Set Default Gem Types\" and select \"Delicate Scarlet Ruby\", \"Stalwart Monarch Topaz\", \"Shifting Twilight Opal\", and \"Austere Earthsiege Diamond\"\n5) Select \"Delete non-listed gemmings\"\n \nNow  look over the \"Head\" chart.  This workflow has caused all the wacky gemmings to be automatically protected for the equipped gear.  \n \nWorkaround is to select gem types before loading the character from armory.  (Or re-gemming the character to match the selected gems, I suppose)  The issue with this workaround is that the gem choice is dependent on the character, so doing things in this order does not necessarily make sense.",
