      "Message": "First of all, what model are you referring to? Secondly, it's really not that good for tanking. Yes it heals the tank, but only 800 or so health at a 4.6 PPM rate. When your taking 20k hits every 2 seconds, that is about 600,000 damage every minute, and you only get healed for 3680 in that time?",

(personally I use prot pally, but a Warrior friend of mine asked me about it, and I offered to post and ask. so, I was asking for ALL tank specs.\r\n\r\nAs to Mending being too small a proc to really matter, that is what I was checking.  And yes, my research also showed about 3-5ppm @800-1000hp heal. I didn't think it was going to be all that helpfull, but I wanted to check.  Since  I had seen on Wow-heroes it was listing mending as a 'near top' enchant for prot pally, so thought I was worth asking.\r\n",
