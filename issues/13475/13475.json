    "Description": "I'm having a lot of trouble with crashes, I can't determine exactly what's causing them, but it happens about once every 5 minutes of use.  This is happening on both Holy & Shadow priest character files.  Error is \"Unhandled exception...\" etc, \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\" (hoorah for .Net's incredibly specific error messages).\nThe most recent occurence of this was when I tried to add a custom gemming option.",
