There was no change in the version number.  4.1.3.0 is the same version I had eariler today.  A second character file gives this error:  No toons I attempt to pull from Battlenet will load.  The bar just spins and never loads.  I've waited as lond as 5 minutes.\n \nThere is an error in XML document (850, 6).\nInstance validation error: 'T11_0' is not a valid value for TierLevels.\n \n== Version: 4.1.3.0 ==\n \n== Error Message ==\nThere is an error in XML document (1086, 6).\nInstance validation error: 'T11_0' is not a valid value for TierLevels.\n \n== StackTrace ==\n   at System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize(XmlReader xmlReader, String encodingStyle, Object events)\n   at System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize(TextReader textReader)\n   at Rawr.Character.LoadFromXml(String xml)\n \n== These are the Steps that I have tried ==\nUninstall and re-install.\nLoading from webpage Directly\nLoading even older files leads to many sucessive errors.\\\nTried loading fresh from battlenet, but it just hangs with no errors.",
