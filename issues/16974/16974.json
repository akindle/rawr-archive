    "Description": "When you are underhit cap for spriest, changing a gem to make you hit capped does not seem to effect the score of the items in the right pane.\nÂ \nExample in point, see attached screenshot, the main items I am talking about are the Circle of Ossus and the Belt of Omission. \nThe main differences between these items are 64hit and 80 crit on the belt, with 80 haste and 64spr on the circle. Using the rel stats value for each one, it would put the circle at 183.84 vs 107.04 for the belt. From the screenshot the belt is rated higher than the circle when the math proves otherwise.",
