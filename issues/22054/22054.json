    "Description": "Hi there, I noticed that Vial of the Shadows proc (both 384, 397 and 410 items) is currently bugged, at least in the Cat model : the proc just seems to provide zero DPS.\nI tried editing (deleting the proc, creating a placeholder) triggering 13000 physicaldamage (15% on phys. hits, 25 cooldown) without any AP scaling and it went back in the charts where it approximatively was before patch I think.\nHope it gets fixed soon, not very annoying tought.",
