    "Description": "Sorry if this has been brought up.  I tried searching and could find nothing.\n \nI've upgraded my system from XP which Rawr ran very fast.  Upon switching to Windows 7 and Vista, rawr runs extremely slow, clicking item slots to bring up the item drop down list or even changing gems takes 30 seconds to 1 minute for the drop down list to appear.\n \nI had the .net 3.5 pre-installed with windows 7, and just recently installed 4.0, I've even goofed around with the compatibility settings.  Still the same thing.  Kind of stumped as to why it's behaving like this.",

Mage and Druid modules seem fine, but the DK one is extremely unresponsive.  Same results if I load freshly from the armory, or if I use an older, locally saved, profile.  It seems most noticeable when trying to use the item set comparison tool; clicking on an empty box to select a piece of gear takes at least 20 seconds, with Rawr as a whole being unresponsive during that time.",
