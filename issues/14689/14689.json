    "Description": "I would LOVE to see a feature where if I have the comparison list focused, that is I just start to type in an items name it would either jump to it, or filter down the list to only items with those words in the name.  \nOR\njust implement the same filter box that we get on on each item when you click on them on the lift.\nÂ \nits a real pain to slowly scroll down the list to find items I may have in my bags to add them as possible options for optimization.\nthanks!!!  cool app so far!  can't wait to see v3.",

      "Message": "Excellent.\r\n\r\nI even had another thought for maybe a far more simple solution for now.  This could be far more simple for now, in the list of possible items you get when you left click on an equipment slot, add \"Make Available to Optimizer\" as one of the contextual menu selections you get when you right click an item in that list.   :)     \r\n\r\n\r\n(hmmm how did I type lift rather than left...oops.)",
