    "Description": "I recently updated to Rawr 2.1.6 from Rawr 2.1.5, and told Rawr to update my item cache from the Armory. When the ordering of gear seemed a bit odd, I noticed that all the gear with gem sockets did not have a socket bonus, although it had correct socket colors. I repeated the process, but updated from Wowhead instead, andreceived an error half way through (something about a bad input string). However, items still did not have proper socket bonuses.",

If you try to update all items from Wowhead, it'll hit a known bug with a couple buggy items. In your situation, I'd suggest reverting to the 2.1.6 default item cache.",
