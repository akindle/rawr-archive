    "Description": "Rawr Version: 2.2.9\n \nThere is still in issue with Elemental shaman and haste effacts.\n \nReducing Haste value to zero - and removing all Haste/speed effects will display casting time on Lightning Bolt as 2sec - which is correct. (with the appropriate Talents)\n \nAdding any Haste Values - by any type of gear - result in an increase of the Cast time, which cause a decrease in the DPS value.\n \nSimply put - it seems all haste values still calculated as nagtive values",
