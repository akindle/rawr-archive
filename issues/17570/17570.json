    "Description": "I'm having problems with the Warlock Optimization template. Put quite simply, I tick the corresponding boxes for food, flasks, Spellstone & Fel Armor and when I re-log the toon & re-optimize, it is asking me to change gems again. Such a superb tool for players wanting to maximize their characters DPS but I'm afraid I'm loosing confidence with the tool of late, can anyone offer any advice please.",

      "Message": "Flappers - I'm afraid I do not understand what problem you're having.  One spot is the phrase \"re-log the toon & re-optimise\" - are you expecting logging in & out of WoW to change the way an optimize works in Rawr?  If so, the first point is to realize that they are unrelated.\r\n\r\nSecond: \"It's asking me to change gems again\" - why do you think it's a problem that Rawr suggests that you change your gems?\r\n\r\nPlease clarify your issue and attach a character file.",
