    "Description": "With Boss Handler checked and T13 10N -> The Average Boss selected, enabling and disabling movement in the Boss Handler's Impedances tab makes no difference to the DPS figure. Setting the equivalent figures (in this case, frequency 100 and duration 6) on the Options tab does.\nÂ \nThis severely underrates the value of the T13 4-piece bonus for arcane mages (such as the attached profile, where the Raid Finder Time Lord's Mantle shows up as a downgrade). This is because being interrupted or forced to move -- especially for long enough to drop our Arcane Blast stacks -- can make AB spam with some AP uptime mana-neutral at realistic amounts of intellect and haste.",
