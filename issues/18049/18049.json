The sentinel's cloak is listed in Rawr as only having 173 armor instead of the 737 green armor value it gets. Thus, the progrm thinks the Icebound has MUCH better mitigation ability.",

      "Message": "No, oakleafwolf, that is incorrect. Take a closer look. Sentinel's War Cloak really does have 173 Armor, and 550ish *Bonus* Armor. Bonus Armor does not benefit from base armor multipliers like Bear Form.\r\n\r\nThe bug here is, as stated previously, that the Icebound Cloak is parsed in Rawr as having 649 Armor. That should be like 150 Armor, and 500 Bonus Armor, or something similar.",
