    "Description": "The gem templates seem to reset all the time. Also it would be nice to select a \"top\" gem of each color, which could be put in any slot. Sometimes it's useful to put a blue gem in a red slot to get metagem bonus, but to do that I need to make a new template for every top gem which puts that gem in every slot.",

Are you saying you're trying to build a gear set including no blue sockets? That's a very rare situation, and not one that we'd want to complicate the gemming template system for, since the Optimizer can handle that very easily.",
