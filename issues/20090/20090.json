    "Description": "As a tank, I have a seperate 'Hitcap' gearset for interruption duty. I use Batch Tools to optimize it along with my main set and this works well so far.\nÂ \nBut now I obtained a second Soul Blade to reforge and enchant it specifically for Hitcap. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to tell Rawr. Is there a chance to fix this?",
