    "Description": "when I freshly load my warlock from the armory it shows up with a hit rating of 388 in Rawr, while it only shows 348 in WoW. I ignored Rawr's recommendation and pushed hit rating to the current level. but with this mis-read from armory is suggest the  wrong stats, while hit rating is still below required levels. this needs to get fixed in order to make rawr's warlock recommendation accurate again.",

      "Message": "If you are having this kind of issue you need to post the character file AND the armory information so we can try to replicate the issue. The problem could simply be something you are doing wrong. A difference of 40 hit could easily mean Hit Food Buff is being applied.",

There are some huge differences (650+ haste in Rawr, 426 IG). I checked my buffs, but the differences didnt come from there.\r\n\r\nHere's my armory and the file : http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Archimonde&n=Kyrra",
