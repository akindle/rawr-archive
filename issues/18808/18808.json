    "Description": "Hi,\n \nOne of the things I find mostly difficult is to compare some pieces of tank gear sometimes. I don't care about threat, but I would like to see Survival AND Mitigation for example. That would help tremendously.\n \nHow hard would be to implement something like that? Is it possible? Like:\nSort: Overall\n - Alphabetically\n - Mitigation\n - Survival\n - Survival + Mitigation\n - Threat",
