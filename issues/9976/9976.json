    "Description": "The 2h mace, World Breaker, has critical strike rating value, meaning that its proc is unconsidered in the calculation of its DPS contribution for Retrib.  From what I've read, this proc yields around 2.3% chance to crit, which is a significant portion of its benefit to the wielder.\nÂ \nAlso, Seal of Blood and Seal of Command are not being considered for DPS, as BE paladin DPS (with a guildie's stats imported) is lower than human paladin DPS at equal gear (T4+T5).",
