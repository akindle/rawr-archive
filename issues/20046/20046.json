    "Description": "The Optimizer Results screen shows \"Current: X -> Optimized: Y\" where X and Y are the 'Overall' score for the different profiles, even if another score has been chosen as the calculation to optimize.\n \nFor example, if I optimize for Mitigation Rating, it will show something like 'Current: 364278, Optimized: 361597' which indicates at first glance that the current gearset is better. However, for Mitigation Rating the suggested gearset is considerably better--it's just on overall it is not, due to perhaps survival or threat values.\n \nThe results page should show the resulting score for the chosen calculation to optimize.",
