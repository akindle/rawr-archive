    "Description": "With  2.2.24 and an Enhancement Shaman, I could select either of my engineering enchants \"Flexweave Underlay\" and \"Springy Arachnoweave\" from the  list of enchants under my Back slot.  they have been removed from the list you get when you try to change the enchant in both 2.2.25 and 2.2.26?\n \nsame goes for the 2 embroidery selections.\n \nI don't see anyplace where i'm change what types of enchants get shown here.\n \nUpdate:  I just remembered to check my boot and hand slots as well.  they also no longer list the engineering schematics I can apply to items in those slots.  \nHyperspeed Accelerators on hands and Nitro Boosts on boots.",
