    "Description": "With the change to not marking gem's available the fix I made a while back to mark cogwheels available on import has been removed. I note the changes to the way gems are treated and wonder if it might be that it is simply the optimser needlessly complaining about lack of cogwheels.\n \nTo test. Import from Battle.Net and set to EU - Khadgar - Ainvar. A Moonkin Druid Engineer, with engineering helm complete with two cogwheels. Note after import succeeds that neither cogwheel is marked as available.\n \nRun optimiser and note it complains neither cogwheel has been marked as available. (It also complains about lack of 3 enchants but that's only because I've just returned to playing the game so the lack of enchants is a laziness issue not a rawr one).\n \nSolution will either be to fix import to mark cogwheels available or to fix optimiser to not complain about lack of enabled cogwheels. It will depend if the optimiser works the same way with cogwheels it does with gems ie: uses templates. I suspect this might cause issues as not all models will have cogwheels enabled in their gemming templates.",
