      "Message": "Not sure if I interpreted your request correctly. But I read the last sentence as if you want to know how to run the newer versions of Rawr.\r\n\r\nTo run a newer version of Rawr you first need to download the new version (There's a download link at the following page http://rawr.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=34466). This file is packed (compressed) so your second step is to un-pack that file. That would leave you with a new folder in which the latest version of rawr can be found. You then go to that new folder and double click on the rawr exe file.",

      "Message": "AH! First of all, your English is good enough to get your idea across to us. So Kudos to you ;) Secondly, unfortunetly, the Hunter developer is Missing in Action (MIA) and hasn't updated the Hunter module since 3.2 came out. What he was doing was he was hard-coding the Armor Penetration coding into the Hunter Module instead of using the Stat.cs file in the RAWR.Base module. Because of this, the Armor Penetration calculations in the Hunter Module is out of date. The Reason he was doing this was because he was trying to copy the information that was in Shandara's Excel File.",
