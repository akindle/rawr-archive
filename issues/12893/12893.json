      "Message": "Resilience works in any PvE setting to reduce the chance to be crit.  The pluses of using Resilience is that a little resilience goes pretty far in reducing chance to be crit.  The downside is that you do not gain the other benefits that Defense offers - Dodge, Parry, Block, all that fun stuff.  For Warriors and Paladins, I would almost never recommend Resil to be used, there's just too much good that comes from Defense.\r\n\r\n81.97 Resil = 1% crit reduction.  To double-check Rawr, you can use the calculator here: (http://www.tankingtips.com/tanking-formulas).\r\n",
