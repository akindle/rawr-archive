      "Message": "Although this should not be happening, a partial explanation can be found here: http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=42386\r\n\r\nRemoving SW:Death from rotation sometimes fixes this. (It does in your case). I am going to rewrite handling of SW:Death to only use it when a full MF will start delaying a higher priority spell. (Besides the case really). If you remove SW: Death from the rotation you should see this issue get fixed.\r\n\r\nBasically what happens when you equip the 25 man T7 shoulders, is that Rawr is finding a very very short optimal rotation, and for some reason its delivering less DPS than a longer one. Thanks for this xml, it should prove helpful in figuring out why this happens.\r\n\r\nYou can mouseover the Shadow w/MindFlay besides Rotation on the Stats tab to see how long it takes before it completes an entire rotation.",
