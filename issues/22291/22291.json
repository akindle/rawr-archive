    "Description": "It seems as if there was a change to the trinket Cunning of the Cruel. In Rawr the ICD is 25 seconds, but after about 3 minutes of testing just spamming scorch (1.28s cast time) I've found it's closer to 8 or 9 seconds. This greatly increases the value. I'm not sure if this is the right place to be posting this, but here it is.",
