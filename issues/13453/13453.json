    "Description": "I have downloaded the Rawr product multiple times and I am sure that the issue is not a botched download. I also had to install .NET Framework to get around a different issue. I currently have .NET 2 /w SP2, .NET 3 /w SP2, and .NET 3.5 SP1. The attached image is the issue I get when trying to load the program. Any help in getting it back to operational status would be greatly appreciated.",
