      "Message": "A tree can't even cast Healing Touch... I guess I could add it though.\r\nNature's Grace would be annoying to model (especially if you want to model keeping a lifebloom stack refreshed). The big problem is that the tree module is built around rotating HoTs, in a tight schedule. With that talent, you change your rotations based on when you crit (probably a regrowth).\r\nMoonglow, Lunar Guidance and Dreamstate, I could add (along with Heart of the Wild, Survival of the Fittest and Nurturing Instinct, so we can have a crit chicken vs. kitty heal competition).\r\n\r\nBut I can tell you right now that moonkin/resto hybrid is viable (just not in high-end raids). I've healed Magtheridon in full feral spec (with Intensity) and topped the healing meter.",

      "Message": "Ok, all the relevant talents have been added to the dev version of Rawr. Even when I picked all HT talents, idol and 4-set T6 (with no talents for rejuv/regrowth), the solver recommends never using HT over other spells. This is because the value of the HoT-part of regrowth is 100% of the max value, making regrowth still more mana-efficient and heal/second efficient.\r\nSo you would pretty have to give the solver no option but to use HT if you want to cast it.\r\n\r\nAnd just to give numbers on the viability of specs (with my gear)...\r\nFull feral: 2150 HPS\r\nFull moonkin: 2200 HPS\r\nMoonglow: 2400 HPS\r\nDreamstate (HT talents, no imp rejuv): 2400 HPS\r\nDreamstate (no HT talents): 2500 HPS\r\nResto: 3050 HPS",
