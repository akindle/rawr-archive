    "Description": "With my frost DW DPS DK set up in Rawr, I decided to see if Unholy would be better. I set up a tandard blood/unholy spec. Surprisingly with Black Icicle and Orca-hunter's Harpoon available for optimizer, it chose 2xBI.\n \nI notice 2Hers do not show up in the mainhand listing if you have an offhand equipped, this may be the root cause - however anything causing Rawr to recommend DW for Unholy needs to be fixed.\n \nhttp://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Argent+Dawn&n=Tzi\n \n \nThanks for your time! It's really appreciated!",

      "Message": "A) Make sure you have 2Hers showing up, under \"Refine Types of Items Listed\". I am not finding any issues with 2Hers not showing up with an OH equipped.\r\nB) Make sure your rotation is properly selected for Unholy\r\nC) It isn't the case that Unholy DW is bad, just that 2H is better because of better weapons. However, as Rawr suggests, 2x Black Ice vs Orca-Hunter's Harpoon is probably the better combo.\r\n\r\nIf you're still having issues, perhaps post your xml file so others can look at it.",

If I then equip say Black Icicle on my OH, my dps display will then drop down to 7700dps. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that, even with the OH equipped but disabled, hit calculations are assuming DW, and adding the DW hit rate penalty. This in fact, is a bug.",
