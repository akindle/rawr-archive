    "Description": "In the gem comparisons view, gem stats are filtered like any other. If I have a Purified Shadow Pearl (+9 Healing +3 Spell Damage and +4 Spirit), it will show up as +9 Healing +4 Spirit in the Tree module (Tree of Life doesn't care much for spell damage).\nIt does however not filter the stats when you hover over a socketed item. This is a problem because only the first two lines are shown (that is, the gem shows as +4 Spirit +3 Spell Damage).\nThere is also a problem because the Insightful Earthstorm Diamond has a property that is so long it will clip into the next gem on the line, making that gem's properties hard to see. It could be somewhat useful to be able to filter this property as well.",

      "Message": "I'm not sure that completely filtering the gem stats is appropriate for this... I made it show all 3 lines when there are 3, and I'll see if I can make it wrap long lines as well, and perhaps gray out irrelevant stats.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about this though... Users/devs, what do you think? Just filter to relevant? Or gray out irrelevant?",

I'm not sure I would prefer it over filtering it though.",
