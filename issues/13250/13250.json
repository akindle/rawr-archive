    "Description": "(Revision 33964)\n \nSigil of the Unfaltering Knight (item ID 40714) is currently imported as providing a flat 53 defense rating.\n \nThe text for the special effect states: \"Your Icy Touch will also increase your defense rating by 53.\"  This effect is shown on Wowhead as proc'ing a buff called \"Unflinching Valor\" when Icy Touch is cast.  This buff increases defense rating by 53 for 30 seconds.\n \nAs a result, the Sigil should be imported as providing no static buffs and instead having a SpecialEffect of increasing defense rating by 53 on Trigger.IcyTouchHit with a duration of 30s.\n \nThis is admittedly only relevant if one assumes that a Frost DK tank with the Howling Blast glyph may not use IT for placing Frost Fever on the target every 30s since HB would already do this.",
