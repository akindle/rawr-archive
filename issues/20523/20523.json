We do NOT mean that it has been fixed and that if you re-download Rawr, it will work.  You have to wait for us to release a new version.\r\nOr you could download the source and compile it yourself if you are son inclined.",

No one was \"pissy\" with you, but you closed this issue without providing any information whatsoever.  Had you been mature enough to answer like Timetodance, there would have been no reason to reopen the issue.  Also, don't assume your users don't search before posting. . .I did and saw nothing remotely similar.  It's now obvious to me who wrote the unbelievably arrogant and ridiculous \"rules\" for posting and helping you with your incredibly buggy code.  Good luck in life with your attitude. . .you'll need it.",
