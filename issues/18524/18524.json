    "Description": "This is really annoying, I can find no way around this.\n \nI have a world drop pve trinket in slot one and a pvp trinket in slot 2.\n \nEverytime I optimize rawr replaces the pve trinket with an identical pvp trinket so I end up with 2 of the same pvp trinkets.\n \nI do not want 2 of the same pvp trinkets, I want to keep the trinkets I have and just optimize my armor.",

So after your response I moved your application from my right screen to my left on and voile, there it is. I have the same problem with the empty triangles, they just do not show up but I know where they are so have never really bothered with it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help :D",
