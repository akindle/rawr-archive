It's a great help in todays WoW environment. That said there does seem to still be some lingering warlock issues. Stats not being accurate to my character, strange suggestions in the optimizer, stat values being listed at negative numbers... Rawr is currently telling me to avoid haste like the plague as it's actually valued at -88.87, and equipping it via any means, buff or stat or gem, causes my DPS to DROP. Very strange indeed. However most everything else is working fantastically, keep up the amazing work everyone.",

      "Message": "I apologize for opening a new issue on this yesterday.  I didnt realize it was a long open issue and I had not looked all the way back in time.\r\n\r\nIn 2.2.24 (the attached xml file runs in that), i have the same issues with negative haste values.  As the xml stands right now the relative stats portion shows haste weighted at 1.62.  This is a reasonable value.  Now we all know that haste > crit.  The optimization that Rawr! performed to generate this xml file put a 12SP/10 crit gem in my pants instead of the 12SP/10 haste gem. \r\n\r\nUpon seeing that I added the same pants i am wearing now, but replaced the 12SP/10crit gem with a 12SP/10haste gem.  If you do that and equip the pants, then the relative haste weighting goes to 24.60 and crtie goes to .73.  I WISH haste had that high or a weighting...  Anyway, I hope this xml file helps you isolate the issue.\r\n\r\nI agree with MoneyLoo...  Thanks for the work.\r\n\r\nTo the OP:  yes, it is possible to get to a point where a 20 haste gem is worth more than a 23 SP gem.  If you look at my attached xml file, haste is rated at 1.62 and SP is rated at 1.40.  20*1.62 = 32.40.  23 *1.40= 32.20.\r\n\r\nAlso, the extra haste may have put him at a haste level where his rotation works better and he is able to cast the DPCT spells instead of having to fill.\r\n\r\nJothay - I have attached my xml file.  I hope my description points you guys in a good direction.  I did not describe the other issues I see in that file because you said they were irrelavent.",

Haste has a VERY spikey nature, we're working to implement a new Graph system for Rawr3 to sure users how Haste's value changes as you go up and down in Rating.",
