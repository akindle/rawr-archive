    "Description": "The Glyph of Fire Nova (item ID 41530) is not available in the latest release of Rawr, or in the Rawr3 Public Beta.\n \nIs there a reason for this glyph not being included? When running simulations in EnhSim it yields better DPS than other combinations for me, so it's a shame I can't pick it in Rawr to see potential gear upgrades.\n \nAny chance of it being added in the near future?\n \nRegards\nCatalina",
