    "Description": "In Rawr 5.0.2.0, the item level filter bands are:\n\n\nMoP heroics from 463-483\nT14.LFR from 483-495\nT14.0 from 496-508\nT14.5 from 509-516\n\n\nThis doesn't seem to match the actual drops from these locations as listed on Wowhead or as present in the item cache.  I assume that the bands have moved since some point during beta.\n\n\nMoP heroics currently drop all iLevel 463, except for a single very low chance drop of an iLevel 476 weapon from the end boss of each instance\nT14.LFR appears to drop all iLevel 476\nT14.0 appears to be at iLevel 489\nT14.5 appears to be at iLevel 502\n\n\nThe result of this is that, for example, selecting the heroics band lists all T14 LFR drops as well as the heroic drops.  Selecting the T14 LFR band adds T14 normal loot at iLevel 489.  And so on.\n\nI think it would make most sense for the MoP heroic band to stop at iLevel 475, even though that will exclude the very rare weapon drops.  T14 LFR would then run 476 to 488, T14 normal from 489-501 and T14.5 from 502 up. These bands would then show you what you have a reasonable chance of seeing from each type of content.\n\nObviously the workround for now is to manually select the iLevel range using the custom slider.",
