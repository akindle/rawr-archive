    "Description": "When I mark my current items in the righthand panel with a blue diamond, I'm trying to get the organizer to only consider that gemming of an item (so that I can see what gear changes it suggests without my having to purchase new gems.)  However, even though the \"Override Regem\" option is OFF, the optimizer still suggests changing the gems in those items.\nÂ \nWhat am I not understanding, please?",

When I raised that number I could see those others and turn them 'empty' so they were not considered.  That did the trick.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
