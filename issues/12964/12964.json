    "Description": "When I \"Load from armory\" my DPS Warrior, his talents don't get populated.  When I load my Enh Shammy the talents do get populated.  The warrior is lvl 71 while the shammy is 80, could the warrior's lower level be causing some problem in the talent populater?  Or is that functionality not implemented for the warrior class?\nÂ \nThanks.",
