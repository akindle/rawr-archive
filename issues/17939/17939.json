    "Description": "I'm finding that the \"Chance to be Avoided\" optimizer setting is trying to cap out my Expertise so that my attacks aren't Parried or Dodged.  While I believe it's an obtainable goal for both, it does rather limit my gear options to strive for both.\nÂ \nI see in the DK models that you can set the optimizer to just reaching the Dodge cap, or just setting a certain Expertise skill level to achieve.  I don't want to turn this into a \"you don't need Expertise\" thread.  All I want to know is if this is this something that can be done with the ProtPally model?  Or is there way to set the \"chance to be avoided\" setting to where it'll do dodge but not parry?",

      "Message": "Expertise Rating is even worse. I guess I don't understand what I'm not being clear about here... The optimizer should provide optimizable values that 'actually matter', and should not provide optimizable values that don't 'actually matter'. Expertise Rating is an example of something that really doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a problem of understanding what 'actually matter' means? Think of how stats benefit you. For many stats, they don't directly benefit you, they give you some other stat, which does directly benefit you (or even some other stat which also doesn't directly benefit you, but gives you yet another stat which does). For example, Strength doesn't directly benefit a Ret paladin. None of his damage is based on strength. It's based on Attack Power, which you get from Strength. But is Attack Power a stat that 'actually matters'? Nope. It translates to DPS, but doesn't have any direct value beyond that. How about Hit Rating? It doesn't directly matter, it contributes to how much of your attacks are missed, which contributes to the total amount of your attacks which are avoided. So does avoided attacks % actually matter? You may think not, since it translates to DPS, just like attack power. But you'd be wrong there, as avoided attacks % also changes your rotation. Missed attacks % also contributes to your chance to have things like taunts resist, whereas dodge/parries don't.\r\n\r\nGoing back to Expertise Rating... It reduces the chance to be dodged and parried. Both of those reduce the total avoided attacks %, but that's it. And (as far as I know), they do so in exactly the same way. So Avoided Attacks % covers everything they do.",

This is a goal I don't see as a priority since my survival and mitigation of incoming damage surpasses the ability to have all of my melee attacks unignored, as I'm already generating a crap ton of threat through spells and other mechanics.\r\n\r\nAn Expertise goal of 82 is far more reasonable and can be achieved without sacrificing other gear or even having to gem or enchant for it.

I've built a Blood Elf Paladin tank in Rawr to simulate the differences.\r\n\r\nFor all tests:\r\n- No buffs checked\r\n- Using the Protection: Crusade talent template\r\n- Nothing changed on the ProtPaladin Options tab\r\n- % Chance to be Crit <= 0\r\n- % Hit Chance >= 100\r\n- Only tanking, non-DPS, non-spell gear from H-ICC-25 selected as available in all slots.\r\n- Default epic gem templates enabled\r\n- BiS enchant for all slot selected as available.\r\n\r\nFor the first test, I tried to reach the parry cap without the glyph of seal of vengeance enabled as it is in the default Crusade talent template.  I set % Cahnce to be Avoided <= 0.  My results:\r\n\r\nFirst run: Optimizer failed\r\nSecond run, this time enabling wrist and hand Expertise enchants: Optimizer Failed\r\nThird run, this time enabling wrist and hand Expertise enchants, along with all avaiable Expertise tanking gear from H-ICC-10: Optimizer failed\r\nForth run, this time enabling wrist and hand Expertise enchants, along with all avaiable Expertise tanking gear from H-ICC-10 and H-ToC-25: Success!\r\nSurvival:\t143586\r\nMititgation:\t204176\r\nThreat:\t\t51882\r\nOVERALL: \t399644\r\n\r\nProtNoob not only needed to sacrifice his wrist and hand enchants for Exp, but also needed to hold on to gear from previous content.  One would say that's not a big deal, but this is a game of numbers, and Rawr is nothing but.  So let's continue...\r\n\r\nNext test, decided to enable the glyph of seal of vengeance, and I kept all the same gear I had selected from H-ICC-10 and H-ToC-25 along with the hand and wrist enchants.  Results:\r\nFirst run: Success!\r\nSurvival:\t148694\r\nMititgation:\t221081\r\nThreat:\t\t54085\r\nOVERALL: \t423860\r\n\r\nNumbers are getting better!  A 24,216 overall point gain just by using one glyph.  Now let's take it one step further...\r\n\r\nThird test, set % Chance to be Avoided <= 7.5, as that's the difference between the dodge cap and parry cap.  All previous gear and enchants that were made available during test 1 and 2 are still available here.  Results:\r\n\r\nFirst run: Success!\r\nSurvival:\t153057\r\nMitigation: \t244322\r\nThreat:\t\t53294\r\nOVERALL:\t450672\r\n\r\nAnd another huge leap in performance!  That's a 26812 overall point gain from test 2, and a whopping 51028 overall point gain from test 1.  Proof is even in the pudding for the broken down Mit/Surv/Threat numbers.  And the real kicker: Rawr didn't need the wrist/hand expertise enchants, nor did it need gear from H-ICC-10 or H-ToC-25.\r\n\r\nSo, let's review.  Is it possible to get to the Parry cap?  Sure.  Will it cost you a lot on your other tanking stats to make it happen?  Sure is.  Is it worth it?  I guess that depends on your opinion.  But looking at it from a pure numbers view, which is what Rawr is all about, I think the 'best performance' is debatable.  So how about that option to just optimize to the dodge cap?\r\n\r\nAnd just in case, I've attached the three character files for each test.",

To me it is common sense that the more conditions you put on the optimiser, the more sacrifices it is going to have to make to reach those condtions.    You would have gotten an even higher score if you have just left the \"avoided attacks\" condtion out all together and let Rawr find it's preferred gear.      If you are after the expertise to increase your threat, then just up the importance of threat in the options.
