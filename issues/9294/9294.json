Funny I was thinking that we needed this today but its a MASSIVE task as there is so much stuff in Rawr you might want to print.\r\n\r\nFor now simply take a screenshot of the app and print that - ie: make sure Rawr is highlighted - press Alt-Prt Scr ie: hold alt key and press Prt Scr key. Open wordpad and paste it into an empty wordpad file. Then just print from wordpad.",
