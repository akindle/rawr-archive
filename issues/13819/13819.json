    "Description": "Using Rawr 2.2.12\nSpark of Hope is only showing the 100 Spirit bonus.\nThere is no mana reduction ability shown in the tooltip or calculations. \nRefreshing the item data from the armory or Wowhead yields no change. \nÂ \nI have tried editing the item, but I'm not really sure how to duplicate the equip bonus with the given tools. \nConsidering constant casting with standard 1.5 seconds GCD, equip bonus on this trinket should be equal to 140 mp5. \nWould this be an adequate workaround?",
