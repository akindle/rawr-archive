      "Message": "Well, in the XML you attached, you're 74 hit rating under the cap, so I'd expect it to recommend gemming for +hit.\r\n\r\nAlso, +hit is still a pretty strong stat even after the spell cap in some situations because so much of your damage is straight-up white swings. I've had Enhance suggest both +hit badge trinkets before because it would get my avoided attacks down to just under 2%. Does seem odd to gem for it past the cap though.",
