    "Description": "I'm not sure how to fix the hit rating for my mage. According to Rawr 2.2.23 the hit cap is 14%. My current hit ratting is 188 (7.17%) and with +6% from talents that puts me at 13.17%. According to Rawr I am only 22 hit rating away from the cap. It is also showing spell power gems as a higher dps then getting hit capped. What am I doing wrong?",
