    "Description": "Given the benefit from reforging Spirit to Hit in order to add dps for Treants can we have an option that allows the user to have reforging from spirit to hit. I agree that not everyone will want this and the default should perhaps be as it is now. However I would like the ability to see how reforging spirit into hit affects my dps.",
