    "Description": "At first I thought that this might be not possible but since the application is heavily math based, I wonder if there is a concept of margin of error in the Optimization results of the Mage class. If there is it might be cool to have a [margin of error] section on the result of the optimizer, along with the DPS and the DPS percentage change. This might be important since if an optimization gives only 0.04% difference from another, a margin of error of 0.1% would make that irrelevant.",

      "Message": "I'm not sure what exactly you mean by margin of error. The solver does not compute variance if that's what you meant, only the average. There is a concept of error if you're using two solvers for display and comparison. In that case you'll see the error % in the solution section under dps that tells you how much the comparison solver differs from display solver. Whether that is something you should use to determine if it's worth to make changes suggested by the optimizer I'm not so sure.",
