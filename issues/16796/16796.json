    "Description": "Saw the update to 2.3.12, rejoiced as I saw the note saying that all items with resilience were being flagged as purchasable PvP items (thus meaning I didn't have to keep a custom edited item d-base anymore that has those items manually removed), and then I cried with sad when I loaded my Death Knight and saw that PvP items were still populating my lists, thus making my already extremely long DPSDK optimize/build upgrade list (hi Bloodysorc!) even longer.",
