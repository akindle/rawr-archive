Works fine for my other toons.\nÂ \nThe toon it fails on is: Neverthere in the Nordrassil Realm. There's something it doesn't like about this toon since I see the same error on another install of the Silverlight version of Rawr with Neverthere while other toons show up just fine.",

      "Message": "I'm still having this problem and it appears to be tied to the enchant on my weapons (or at least it is effected by it).  If I use either the Mongoose or the Rune of the Fallen Crusader enchant on either of my weapons I will get NaN for both overall and DPS numbers.  There is also a problem with the Executioner enchant; changing my off-hand from No Enchant to Executioner will change my DPS from 2583 to 1055 (the enchant effects both weapons).  This has been effecting me since at least 2.2.24.  Awesome app though; thanks!",
