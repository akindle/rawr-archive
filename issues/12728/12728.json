    "Description": "Veteran of the 3rd War seems to only grant 3% Strength instead of 6% like tooltip and ingame-values reflect.\nMiss chance seems to be to high. Even if we can't be sure of the miss cap, it's most likely 16 (see http://elitistjerks.com/1053037-post335.html).\nMy miss chance at 544 def should be around 13.77 (4.4 base, 2 racial, 3 talent, 5.77 before DR -> 4.37 after DR).\nRawr displays a miss chance of 14.74, which might be a calculation error, or might be the result of a suspected miss cap of ~46. Either way, I'd suggest looking into it.\nÂ \nAlso, Parry Chance is too high. At 560 Parry Rating and 14% from Swordshattering/Blade Barrier, Rawr displays 33.67 against level 80, while my character sheet\nand my own calculations show a parry chance of 31.38 against level 80. considering that I'm missing 30 str in rawr, due to the Veteran bug, the displayed parry\nchance should be slightly lower, not >2% higher than the ingame values.",
