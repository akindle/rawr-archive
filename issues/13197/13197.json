    "Description": "With my setup this list shows “Waistguard of the Creator” with Agi/Stam+Agi thus giving setbonus to be the best choice at 344dps.\n \nThe same belt with Agi+Agi and not giving setbonus ends up on 233dps\n \nIt shows “Soul-Devouring Cinch” with Agi+Agi+Agi even lower than the previously mentioned at 232dps\n \nOn top of this it shows “Jorach’s Crocolisk Skin Belt” with Agi/Stam+Agi at 274dps, which is above “Soul-Devouring Cinch” even thou the latter has more of everything.\n \nClearly something isn’t being calculated correctly in this model, especially for the items that are gemmed to not get the socket bonus, or having a beneficial socket bonus.\n \n“Soul-Devouring Cinch” has a socket bonus (+12 AP), but this is not loaded from WoWhead when trying to update.\n \nThe issues of miscalculation seem to happen where the socket bonus is not working, due to gem colors, or the socket bonus can’t be updated.",
