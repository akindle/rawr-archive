      "Message": "Way to miss the point. The entire reason I found this out is for raiding application. Namely I was making a Thorim Solo Tanking set for my druid. I was trying to figure out how much items with resilience and defense I needed to get the extra 8% crit reduction. I thought changing a number from 35 to 50 in 1 line of code wouldn't be so hard. Nowhere in my post did I mention any modeling needed for pvp. But thanks anyway. Oh and 2 months after my original post. Nice and fast as well.",
