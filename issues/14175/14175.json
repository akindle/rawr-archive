    "Description": "I have been having problems in which Rawr recommends a metagem for my head slot but then does not recommend the gems that would activate that metagem.  For example, my current metagem (which is also recommended by Rawr) requires 2 blue gems be equipped but Rawr gemming recommendations do not include any blue gems.",
