I REALLY expected the Mage Armor, Molten Armor buff choice to be on the Buff Tab, not the options tab.\r\n\r\nChanging this to a feature request to move this option to the Buffs tab.  \r\n\r\nAlso, it should probably be auto-solved for the best DPS instead of being an option at all.",

      "Message": "I agree with moving the armor choice to the buff tab - it's more intuitive.\r\n\r\nIn the comparison tab, select the Mage Armor panel.  This seems like a good solution to your concerns about the armors and still allows users control for selecting between the 2 armors without auto solving.  Given my gear, it seems that the 10 minute mark is the length needed when mage armors passive regen outweights the crit for overall damage and overall dps.",

      "Message": "Do we have a way currently to filter self-only buffs that are class specific so they don't show in other modules?\r\n\r\nFor buffs that we want to auto-select based on some settings, what is the prefered way to handle this? Right now for example I auto-enable Winter's Chill if you have the talent for it, but this causes it not to show up in the buff comparison since it's always on regardless of what is selected in the buff tab. Could there be a parameter that is passes to calculation to indicate not to auto-select buffs when computing the buff comparison chart?",

      "Message": "Buff filtering from other modules is done just by using different stats. ie make a new stat called \"Mage Spell Crit %\" and give Molten Armor 3 of it, and count it accordingly. Winter's Chill I'd say use a different stat as well (10 \"Frost Crit %\"), don't auto turn on/off the buff at all, make the talent also give 10 \"Frost Crit %\", and cap all \"Frost Crit %\" at 10 in the character calculation. That way, if they've got the talent, the buff does nothing for them, and vice versa, and if they've got neither, both show up as upgrades.",
