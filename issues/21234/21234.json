    "Description": "I'm trying to figure out gear updates in the latest version of rawr cat, and it seems to show a wrong value for my mastery. In game I have 1676 mastery rating unbuffed, but Rawr lists it as 2171.259 (unbuffed also, with exactly the same gear, gems, enchanting, reforging and spec). It lists my haste and crit values correctly however. \nI did notice changing the reforge on an item caused some funky numbers though. If I change any crit->haste reforge to be \"not reforged\" it shows my mastery correctly. Other reforges (that don't affect mastery) sometimes change the mastery value by some decimal places. I've attached my character file so you can test it out.",

      "Message": "Just want to say that this bug is still present in the latest build (4.2.3 WPF as well as the web version) and still persists even with a completely new character file I made from scratch (attached). Only difference is that now I have to un-reforge *all* crit->haste to get mastery to show up as the correct value. As soon as I reforge any crit back to haste (which I'm doing on shoulders/legs/weapon/boots), I get an extra 518.496 mastery out of nowhere.",
