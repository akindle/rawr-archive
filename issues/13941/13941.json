    "Description": "DPSDK Tier 9 set bonuses for horde players may behave strangely. This is not an issue with rawr, this is an issue with wowhead. On wowhead, the set name is listed as Kolitra's Battlgear, whereas the armory (and every tier piece) shows it as Koltira's. The Set bonuses will parse correctly when the items say they are in the Koltira's Battlegear set. If yours are not behaving correctly, open them in the item editor and change the set name from Kolitra's Battlegear to Koltira's Battlegear.\nÂ \nThis issue currently impacts only the SVN version and, depending on how long it takes wowhead to correct this, may never impact a release, but should still be noted here.",
