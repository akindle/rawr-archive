    "Description": "This issue has existed longer than version 2.2.24.  I just got around to posting it now.  I am a destro lock with an imp out. If you open the enclosed .xml file and look at the food buff section you will see:\n \n1) Spell Power food (pet portion) = 30.79\n2) Fish Feast (pet portion) = 4.14\n3) points assigned to the caster for BOTH foods = 60.36 <-- that is good\n \nNow I know that SP food = 46 SP/40Sta and FF = 46 SP/40Sta/80AP.  I could see the pet being buffed more from FF than from SP food. What is the mechanism that would give a pet more points for the SP food buffs when those buffs are fewer than the FF buffs?\n \nI am hoping that this may give you insight into toher lock or global issues.\n \nThanks for your work.",
