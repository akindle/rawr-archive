    "Description": "Hello, I tried searching the issue tracker and did not find anything related to this issue.\n \nI'm on windows 7, have silverlight 4, and everything \"as far as I know\" seems to be updated. I've tried the offline and online version of Rarw4 and cant get it to work.\n \nPROBLEM: The Filter is only showing certain items and I can't update the item cache.\nUnder the \"Filter by Item Type\" it is only possible (the rest are greyed out) to select Leather, Staff, Polearm, 2H Mace, Off-Hand-Misc., Ranged-Relic. Everything else is greyed out, so I thought I needed to update the cache. I've tried all the reset options, and redownload options availalbe, rarw4 reloads, but I still get the same filter problem.\n \nAny thoughts?",
