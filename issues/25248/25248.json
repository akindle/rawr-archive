      "Message": "Rawr is a community developed program.  Unfortunately we are currently short on developers.  If you would like to help develop, or know someone that can help, please have a read of [this](https://rawr.codeplex.com/discussions/472104) thread.  If you can't help us develop, please bear with us as we would love for some beta testers once things are back in swing.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the issue closure emails, that was just me cleaning up some very old issues that no longer apply to the current status of certain modules.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for the feedback.  We [the developers] would love to see Rawr back to its glory days of WotLK as well.",
