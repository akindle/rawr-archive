      "Message": "I checked vs. the Armory, and I cannot explain why Rawr is coming up 6 short here.  Your base health is correct, 141 * 1.1448 is about 161.  Your items have 2770 stamina on them.  2770 * 1.1448 is about 3171.  3171 + 161 = 3332.  Yet your toon is reporting 3338.\r\n\r\nYou might want to try to pinpoint the problem by removing items, one at a time, from both your toon and from Rawr, and see where the discrepancy is.  If it's gradual, that means there's a rounding error somewhere.  But if one item is the problem, we can look into fixing that item.\r\n\r\nI pulled another toon and it did not have any stamina issue.",
