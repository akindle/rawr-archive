    "Description": "I would find it extremely useful to be able to add my own notes to items in the item editor and have those notes displayed in the item tooltips. I would most likely include item sources in my own notes, and perhaps odd characteristics that are not handled by the item editor, such as item-use effects and cooldowns.",

My bank is pretty full and somewhat disorganized, so for items which have only situational uses, this would make it easier for me to keep track of what is already available for me to equip.",
