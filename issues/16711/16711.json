    "Description": "I have discovered a number of items with \"Unknown Location, please refresh\" as their source.    These do NOT show up when you tick the Unknown, Not Found on Armory or Other filters.   The only way I have been able to get them to show up is to set up an \"All items\" filter.  Once you refresh the data from WowHead then everything is fine, but there is obviously something wrong with the Unknown filter not picking these up.\nÂ \nA few examples I have found are \"Mariel's Sorrow\" from HToC and the tanking cape from the first boss in H HoR.",

      "Message": "I have also noticed this behavior but with one noticable difference. The 'Unknown (Refresh)' and 'Not found on armory' filters will no show these items, however the 'Other' filter will show/hide these items on selecting/deselecting.\r\n\r\nOut of habit, I leave all three of these selected and 'Refresh Relevants from Armory' when they are items I am looking for. This will clear up most but if a few are left then I do the same with 'Refresh Revevants from Wowhead.' ",
