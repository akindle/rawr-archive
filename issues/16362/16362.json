    "Description": "I'm not sure if this is correct or not. I'm playing around with RAWR to see what I would need to at least hit ArP Hard Cap. After a few items, I'm able to hit Armor Pen Hard Cap with a 1401 rating. Grated my Avoided Attacks are at 4.4% but still.. Anyway, when I look at the Armor Mitigation line, it is still showing 2% mitigated. I tried lowering the mob's lvl from 83 to 80 and nothing changed. Now I understand that ArP only reduces a third of the boss' total armor (compared to 3.1 when it reduced all), but still I find it odd that the program will not go any lower. I even tried forcing more ArP beyond the cap to see if it would drop (which it didn't). Any thoughts on the matter.",
