    "Description": "Hi,\nsince some time I try to get Rawr working, but whatever I do, it doesn't work.\nEvery time I want to start it I get an Error.\nIn german it is \"Diese Anwendung konnte nicht gestartet werden, weil die Anwendungskonfiguration nicht korrekt ist. Zur Problembehandlung sollten Sie die Anwendung neu installieren.\"\nRougly translated it says \"The application could'nt have been started, because the application configuration isn't correct. In order to solve the problem you should reinstall the application.\"\nI tried removing every single .NET-version I've got and installed 2.0 from the link in the ReadMe, but nothing changes. I just don't know, what to do.\nMFG\nRequu",
