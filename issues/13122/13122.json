    "Description": "I'm using Rawr 2.2.1, Bear Model.  When I try to add an item that is on the Armory, but not yet on Wowhead, Rawr gives and error that it is unable to load the item.  This occurs even if I have the \"Wowhead\" box unchecked as a possible source for the item. It occurs if I try to add the item by URI, Item ID or Name.  I've been testing this by using the new Hardmode loot from Ulduar that is available on the Armory, but hasn't yet been integrated into Wowhead.  Specifically, this error occurs with Dark Edge of Depravity, Embrace of the Gladiator, Legguards of Cunning Deception and Shoulderpads of the Intruder.",
