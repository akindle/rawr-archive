    "Description": "I would like to propose an option to automate the reforging process to reforge the currently worn set to reflect the current set that is equipped in the Rawr addon. The option could also check if the character is actually wearing the exactly identical set.\nÂ \nI know ReforgeLite does something like that but based on it's own calculations...not sure though if the automatic reforging is done in an efficient way.",
