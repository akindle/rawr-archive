    "Description": "Wondering if this is an issue with the trinket just not being modeled properly at all yet, or an issue of it being modeled correctly in the Moonkin module for our rotation. I find it hard to believe that it's ranked below the Mercurial Alchemist Stone (SP/Haste equip) in terms of DPS provided both Sustained and Burst. Apologies in advance if this has been covered in some other Issue, but the only result that came up for Phylactery was for Fire Mages in Rawr.Mage asking kind of the same question, but as I said since I don't know if it's an issue with modeling on the Phylactery itself or an issue with it's modeling in Rawr.Moonkin, I would post a separate issue for it.",
