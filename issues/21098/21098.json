In the Silverlight button it doesn't exist initially but does appear  once you have loaded the first toon, but it only loads another toon in that same first position, it doesn't load a second toon :(\r\n\r\nSo I am a step closer, but still can't get the 2nd profile to load in the Silverlight version.    I'll give the WPF a go now.\r\n",
