    "Description": "My character has mixology and when I tick the Flask of Draconic Mind as my chosen flask it seems to be only treating the 80 int mixology bonus as the flask effect and then adding another small bonus on top of that. So I go from 4941 - 5034 int when I tick Draconic Mind (mixology). I think the 13 extra is probably Heart of the Wild's 6% being applied to the 80 int from the flask (seems close enough given rounding).\nÂ \nI'd expect that to go from 4941 - 5321. Since the initial flask buff is untickable now, only the mixology bit as enabled maybe it's not added that? I've attached a save of my character, hopefully it captured the buffs that are applied. Character is Carnacki@nagrand",

The way the flasks and mixology's is set up in Rawr you have:\r\nFlask of the Draconic Mind (+300 Intellect)\r\n- Flask of the Draconic Mind (Mixology) (+80 Intellect)\r\n\r\nYou tick both to get the full 380 Int bonus, not just the Mixology. Any other % modifiers to your Int after that would also increase you further.",
