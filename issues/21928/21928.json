    "Description": "I always turn on Use Boss Handler before optimizing to avoid a Patchwerk bias. However, the lines for certain secondary stats -- notably haste and crit -- wiggle 10 or 20 points seemingly at random in the Stats Graph. This suggests that some random noise may be throwing the optimization results off; is there any way to be sure this isn't happening? (If it is, it can probably be fixed by using interpolated values when optimizing or drawing the graph, at least for stats whose non-negligible real nonlinearities are known.)",
