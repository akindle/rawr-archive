    "Description": "When Optimizer is set to the lowest setting it is giving me a rating of 6531.119 dps with 0% avoidance. When I turn the setting up at all the dps it gives me drops by about 300. What it is recommending does not gain me a set bonus or anything else that is noticeable.  Further more - it is recommending replacing Twisted Visage with Journey's end when Twisted Visage is a better DPS weapon in every way imaginable...\nÂ \nNeedless to say, I'm pretty confused.",
