    "Description": "I'd like to request a feature, please. \n \nCan you build in a way to filter *just* Shadowmourne? I can filter by ilvl, but I'd like to see the 277 heroic ICC upgrades, and let's face it -- it's a huge upgrade for every two-hander plate-wearer and only a very small fraction of us will actually get the item. And in my guild, that won't be me ;P\n \nThanks!\n- Aular",
