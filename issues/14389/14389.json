    "Description": "Running Batch Optimize with the attached .xml files (roughly mid settings on trys and thoroughness) I get unexpected results.\n \nBatch Test.xml is the batch settings.\nErd Gear.xml has all of my gear (loaded from Character Profiler).  In batch optimization it is the first entry with a 0.001 weight.\nErd Heal.xml has my resto spec and fight settings.  It is not close to gear-complete.  Weight is 1.\n \nMy understanding is that Batch Optimize uses the gear from the first .xml, and the talents and fight settings from each particular .xml.\n \nOptimization does not recommend any changes to \"Heal\".  However, \"Malfurion's Leggings of Triumph\" show as a very large direct upgrade (score jump from 1520 to 1750) when viewed in the main window for \"Heal.\"",
