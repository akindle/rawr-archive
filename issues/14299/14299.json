    "Description": "Hello again,\n \nI checked my filters over and over again but somehow the PvP filter is set on on and still the weapons don't appear. However, they are in the database and I think there's something wrong with the filter there. I will add the weapon I am looking for by hand now, just wanted to share that with the developers :).\n \nEdit: Funny enough, the newly added item isn't showing up neither. Strange!",

      "Message": "Jothay and I talked about separating Hide Bad Items into hiding Tank, Caster, and PvP separately from one another.  This would be in the event that you want to show resil gear but not caster/tank gear...or if you want to show tank gear due to being in a situation where you need to DPS but may throw on a shield in the event that a tank dies (okay, that's a stretch).\r\n\r\nI think he's changing that now.",
