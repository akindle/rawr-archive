    "Description": "I cannot get my char from armory since this weeks armory maintance. Message:\nStep Name: Get Character\nDescription: No character returned from the Armory. Is the Armory down?\n \nArmory works at:\nhttp://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Die+ewige+Wacht&n=Sahkyo&rhtml=true\n \nBut it does not work at the adress I used until last week:\nhttp://armory.wow-europe.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Die+ewige+Wacht&n=Sahkyo\n \nSo it seems Blizzard has disabled some of the redirect adresses - maybe the one rawr uses is not working. Is there a possibillity to change the URL Rawr uses?",

They have fixed the problem in their side.\r\n\r\nThere's a \"problem\" with EU armory since yesterday, they are internally redirecting all requests to from\r\nhttp://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml\r\nto\r\nhttps://eu.battle.net/login/login.xml?r ... -sheet.xml and then back to\r\nhttp://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml\r\nand our bot wasn't being redirected through that new connection. We made a quick fix on our side so everything should be working fine now, thanks for your patience :)",
