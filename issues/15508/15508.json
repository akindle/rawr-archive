    "Description": "Using Rawr 2.3.2 on my Troll Hunter \"ZeroUm\" @ Warsong-US.\n \nI'm seeing some weird suggestions of gems to use, it tells me I'll get at least 60+ dps increase using a mana regen blue gem instead of a pure agility. It also suggests stamina, crit and hit rating gems. Critical gem suggestions are ok, but I'm really confused by these other ones:\n \n- Mana would only be more useful if I were to run OOM before the boss fight ends, but I do configure the fight simulation to last less than the OOM calculated value, and the suggestion doesn't change.\n- Stamina is useful in the Survival tree, but I'm using Marksmanship and even then agility takes precedence.\n- Hit rating gems would be nice if I weren't hit capped already.\n \nPlease correct me if I'm wrong.",

Try purchasing a Nightmare Tear and equipping it to fulfill your Meta Gem Requirements (it satisfies the Relentless on it's own).",
