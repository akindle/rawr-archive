    "Description": "I am unable to include the actual error code because of the fact that RAWR locks up, but when you try to load a character from Battle.net with 8-bit ascii characters in the name, it locks up.\n \n8-bit ascii being characters such as Ä and ö \n \nIt successfully loads the character and all the items, however it will not do any other number crunching nor will it allow you to click on anything.",
