    "Description": "I have checked the relevency stats for Bears, Moonkins, enhancement, DKDPS, and DKTank; all of whom have relics as a relevent stat. I've checked all the known areas that the Idol, Libram, Sigil, and Totems appear and Relics are associated with all of them. So I am unsure as to the reason why Relics just will not show up in the Range slot. All relics in Wrath and in Cata are associated with being a relic in the Item Cache so I know they should appear if the slot is working.",
