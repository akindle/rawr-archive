    "Description": "I have my Druid Moonkin set up pretty close to how i would expect. SP>all other stats.\nWhen I check Moonkin form, Int jumps tremendously making 16 Int Gem> 19 SP.\nI noticed it when it made Greatness Card: Int go from slightly less than Illustration of Dragon Soul(172-195) all the way up to 350, more than double before i checked that 1 box.\nWhen i added gemming with a 16 int gem, it was then worth more than the exact same item gemmed for 19 SP.",
