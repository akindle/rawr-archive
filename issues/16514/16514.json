    "Description": "It seems that the HPS of Flash Heal is being calculated including crit chance but that the HPS of Binding Heal is not. If I use the formula: (Max + Min) / 2 / Cast_time * (1.0 + (Crit_chance / 2)) I get a very close number to what Rawr is displaying for Flash Heal's HPS, but to get something similar to the displayed value of Binding Heal I have to use: (Max + Min) / 2 / Cast_time. This makes Binding Heal appear to be much worse than it is for cases in which mana does not matter but throughput does (such as the Dreamwalker fight).",
