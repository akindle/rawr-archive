Results of my optimize attached\nÂ \nI optimized for mitigation with health requirement at 180,000 and mastery weighted as high as it can go.",

      "Message": "That's not how those optimizer sub-points work since it wouldn't know what is \"good enough.\" \r\nAnd while it looks like it's putting everything into parry, it's not quite that drastic.  There is a benefit to having more parry than dodge through some of the special effects and the stacking nature of avoidance.  Since you already have (presumably) 4% parry coming from the Runeforge, plus an additional 20% for 12 secs (more if you have 4t12) every 90 secs.  The diminishing returns at these numbers are not low enough to reduce the value of parry past dodge.  ",
