    "Description": "Looking over gear for my resto druid, I noticed that some of my gear was not appearing in the chart on the right. Looking into my settings, I determined that this was because I had \"Cloth\" items turned off in the items to display option.\nÂ \nIt seems odd to me to help a user find gear improvements if they can't see their current gear in the chart due to filters or item type options. As such, I'd like to suggest that currently equipped gear is ALWAYS shown on the chart, no matter what filters/settings would otherwise hide it. This would allow non-priest healers (for example) to disable the vast list of cloth gear while still seeing where their current cloth gear falls on the charts and make finding suitable upgrades easier.",
