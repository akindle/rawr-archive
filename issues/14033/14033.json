    "Description": "About a month ago I read that the reason you can't load previously saved characters is because Rawr accesses The Armory to check what race and class your character is (or something along those lines). \nÂ \nMy suggestion is to remove this limitation either by giving the option to ignore it, by asking the user to input whatever information Rawr needs or by saving the information needed into the XML character file. I knows this doesn't happen often, but when it does, it is annoying not being able to optimize your character just because Blizzard decided to take down the armory for a few days.",

I found I could avoid weird issues if I don't use the previous folder).",
