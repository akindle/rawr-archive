This brings the DPS value in line with WC and SimC.<br />- Add default glyphs.<br />- Add a buff set.<br /><b>Rawr.Hunter:</b><br />- Big check in. Hacked up a bunch of stuff to start getting some numbers out that look kinda reasonable.

(WPF only)<br /><b>Rawr.Mage:</b><br />- Changing 4T12 to multiplicative mana reduction. <br />- Fix for comparison calculations. <br />- Performance improvements. <br />- Nonsummon damage procs benefit from mana adept, Moonwell Chalice can stack with other item based cooldowns. <br />- Adding hard cast Pyro to spell info. <br />- Passive healing parameter for survivability model. <br /><b>Rawr.ProtWarr:</b><br />- Fixed missed Strength-&gt;Parry calc in ProtWarrior<br />- Fix for performance issues<br /><b>Rawr.DPSWarr:</b><br />- Fix for performance problems<br /><b>Rawr.ProtPaladin:</b><br />- New ranking mode based solely on combat table coverage. <br /><b>Rawr.DPSDK:</b><br />- Defect 21131: Reduce problems with stacking Razorice, Cinderglacier, and Fallen Crusader<br />- Reduce issue with creating a new character. <br />- Partial fix for defect 21185: A bug where a possible negative crit chance could cause issues in Hit and therefore translate to Expertise being worth more than it should. <br />- Fix for 21069: Switch SD procs from cheaper DCs to be like Rime, which means extra DCs. <br />- Fix for 21173: DMC:Hurricane was not properly handling the proc. Now it does and it&#39;s scary for DWFrost! <br />- Improve rotation calculations to include partial valued spells. This should smooth out some Haste issues, but not all.<br />- Little bit of cleanup.<br />- Switch SpecialEffect handling to use the new dictionary methods.<br />- Improve KM handling<br />- Improve Runic Corruption handling.<br /><b>Rawr.TankDK:</b><br />- Update DPS from Boss values to ensure proper handling of non-physical dots as well as % of health values in the DPH numbers. <br /><b>Rawr.Tree:</b><br />- Fix Eye of Blazing Power to be affected by crit, Master Shapeshifter and Tree of Life <br /><b>Rawr.Moonkin:</b><br />- Remove treant melee crit depression, because my testing showed a flat 5% crit rate on a boss-level dummy.<br />- Modify 2T12 set bonus down to 3.5 casts/proc, and a 2.5% crit rate. <br /><b>Rawr.Enhance:</b><br />- Partially apply Patch 9898: Tweaks to EnhSim Export

Wasn&#39;t applying ratings to BasicStats before displaying them. <br />- Double-Dipping for Buff/Talent Brittle Bones<br />- Replaced the GetBuffsStats framework in DPSDK to what DPSWarr uses to prevent conflicting buff/talents.

Adjusting Per-hit numbers for SS that were &gt; 5% off from what I was seeing in BWD last night. <br />- Update UH rotation to not be so expensive. :( The dynamic version is much more accurate, but also much more expensive. <br /><b>Rawr.Tree:</b><br />- Complete redesign<br /><b>Rawr.Warlock:</b><br />- Mastery and Improved Corruption are additive modifiers<br />- Shadow Embrace is +3/4/5%, not 9/12/15%<br />- Bane of Doom is not affected by Shadow Embrace or Haunt <br />- Add some more pet calculation values to the display; relabel Bonus Damage as Spell Power.<br />- Revert erroneous Shadow Embrace change.<br />- Try to make displayed pet stats a little closer to in-game character sheet (for now, tested with Felhunter only).<br />- Update Shadow Bite for 4.1 changes.<br />- Include embedded effects when determining trinket relevancy (e.g. Heart of Ignacious). 
<h2>Rawr 4.1.05</h2><b>General:</b><br />- Aligned CalcOpts panes for all Tank models<br /><b>Rawr.Base:</b><br />- Removed BossAttackPower stat as it no longer exists in game (Demo shout and others were changed to a % dmg mult)<br />- Efflorescence Talent no longer requires Living Seed Talent as a pre-req<br /><b>Rawr.BossHandler:</b><br />- Avg Attack/TargetGroup and Impedance calcs now calc in the PhaseUptime to reduce oversizing<br />- Attack editor fixed for standard usability scenarios<br /><b>Rawr.Buffs:</b><br />- Updated 4.1&#39;s Steelskin&#39;s flask bonus from 300 stam to 450 stam<br /><b>Rawr.Items:</b><br />- Updated 4.1 sources with correct locations<br />- Fixed Shard of Woes&#39; Mana reduction not showing<br />- Updated Mastery stat to 356 ilvl version of Manacles of the Sleeping Beast<br />- Initial working for automating Holiday item being treated as quest rewards (Holiday daily satchels; which the holiday items drop from; are considered quest rewards).

This means uses the same calc method and is soft-capped. Gets values from the Attacks that would affect a MeleeDPS role (mostly just Raid AoE). Also splits the score down for different types of damage like Fire vs Physical<br />- Fury&#39;s Precision now properly applies the 40% Bonnus White damage<br />- Removed some dead code<br />- Updated the Rage from Incoming Damage calculations to iterate through boss attacks using damage and uptime values. Still using the Cataclysm modifier of 2.5/453.3 though, need to determine the new modifier. This is a very small amount of change on the rage levels so it&#39;s not going to seriously throw off calculations for being wrong<br />- Fix for issue 20619: Fury Mastery value off.

And threat is OK as long as it&#39;s using the pre-set rotation. DPSDK on the other hand still needs work. It&#39;s work will dial in the Threat on TankDK.

The info in the boxes is now tied to a label at the top. This saved you some space on the Stats pane<br />- Removed the usage of LocationFactory as a separate cache, there is now no need for ItemSource.xml<br />- Resorted the Wowhead.cs file so its easier to find stuff (had gotten rather haphazard)<br />- Working on getting Update Item Cache from Wowhead working.

Other classes coming soon<br />- Added Death Knights to that dialog <br />- Fix for Issue 16401: Buff.AllowedClasses wasn&#39;t being consistently enforced - Changed the implementation in Base to enforce allowed classes and professions. Charts, the Buff Control and the affected models should now all work properly<br /><b>Rawr.BossHandler:</b><br />- Raid Boss armour confirmed at 11977 not 10643<br />- Issue 19328 Work: GetDPSbyType always uses avoidance stats - Added some if statements into the calc that would be for formulating against other attack types.

DPSWarr by default doesn&#39;t show them but does leave you the option to turn them on<br />- - SMT wasn&#39;t handled correctly. I&#39;ve fixed this<br />- - Having a non-1h in the OffHand is throwing a NaN on that chart, so it ends up not knowing what to do and crashes. Added a handler to check for NaN in that core file so no models can make that break anymore.<br />- Modelled BonusWhiteDamageMultiplier (some new trinkets use this)<br />- More overhauling<br />- Fixed a bug that would make all the Buff Selectors disappear<br />- More overhauling<br />- Added a notice that Fury doesnt work yet, invalidated its calcs<br />- Gemming Templates now generate for 4 metas instead of just Chaotic<br /><b>Rawr.Enhance:</b><br />- Initial work at implementing T11<br />- Removed T7-T9<br />- Fix for issue 19428 - hit rating required was using physical not spell hit <br /><b>Rawr.Mage:</b><br />- Added average mode for mirror images, default to disabled<br />- Performance improvement for incremental optimization with advanced mana segment constraints. <br /><b>Rawr.Moonkin:</b><br />- Add Silences to the boss options handling code in Moonkin<br />- Removed a lot of else&#39;s that should enable handling of single SpecialEffects with multiple stats that fall into separate handler categories<br />- Enable trinket procs that apply DoT effects.<br />- Fix mana proc handling.
