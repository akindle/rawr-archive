<h1>Rawr.Enhance</h1>
<p>Rawr.Enhance is a tool to help Enhancement Shamans choose and optimize their gear, from brand new 85s, to endgame raiders.&nbsp; It incorporates an &quot;Export to EnhSim&quot; (<a href="http://enhsim.codeplex.com">http://enhsim.codeplex.com</a>) feature which allows
 users who want a deeper analysis of their stats to copy n' paste their stats directly into EnhSimGUI.&nbsp; For the vast majority of users however Rawr.Enhance aims to be more than adequate for their needs.</p>
