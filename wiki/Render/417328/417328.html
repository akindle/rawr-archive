<li><strong>Trinket Offset:</strong> This indicates that you unequip and then reequip one of your trinkets before you begin attacking in order to desynchronize their proc timers. This is benefitial when you have two trinkets whose procs provide such stats which
 have caps (such as Armor Penetration) so that you can gain the benefit of both a majority of the time.
