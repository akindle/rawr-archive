<p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Rawr 4.1.0:</strong><br>
- To speed up optimizing all mobs are assumed to be poisonable. Assorted fixes for Assassination. First work on Combat<br>
- Ported a fix Poison fix made in Ass to Combat and Subt. Forgot to remove a line added only for testing<br>
- More work on Combat. Switched glyphs in Prime and Major glyph categories. Added glyphs of Blind and Vanish. Added saved talent specs for Assassination and Combat (glyphs don't load yet).<br>
- Fixed glyph numbering. Glyphs now load when picking a saved talent spec<br>
