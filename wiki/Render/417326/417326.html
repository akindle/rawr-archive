<h1>Rawr.Bear</h1>
<p>Rawr.Bear is a tool to help Bears choose and optimize their gear, from brand new 85s, to endgame raiders.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:large">Current Status</span></p>
<p>This model is currently fully functional, consistently maintained by <strong>Astrylian</strong>, the head of the Rawr project, and you can safely rely on it for your gear choices in Cataclysm.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:normal">Weighting Adjustments</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hits to Survive:</strong> Once you have a certain amount of Health in a level of content (Dungeons, Heroics, Raids, Heroic Raids) there isn't much point to stacking things like Stamina and it becomes more effective to continue stacking Mitigation
 stats like Armor and Dodge. This section determines how many hits you need to be able to survive without heals. Only change this if you are having problems surviving your raids (and are above the soft caps resulting from the setting).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</li><li><strong>Threat Scale:</strong> A scaling modifier for your threat calculations in Rawr
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Many tanks are geared well enough that they don't need to worry about having DPS out-threating them. Set it to a low number like 1.0 or 0.0 to have the overall score focus on Mitigation and Survival
</li><li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You have this one particular DPS in the raid who has been consistently out-threating you. You want to one up him so he stops pulling mobs off you. Set it to Crazy about Threat to have the overall score focus a lot more on threat
 abilities, talents and glyphs. </li></ul>
