<h1>Professions</h1>
<p>Added in version 2.2.28, Profession selectors are now available on the Stats Pane. Professions will automatically be populated on Load from Armory calls or can be manually selected/changed from the Stats Pane. This in combination with the Enforce Profession
 Requirements setting will change the behavior of Rawr with Profession-related character effects.<br>
