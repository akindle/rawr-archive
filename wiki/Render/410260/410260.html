<p>This tab holds information regarding how often in a fight your toon is in that particular situation. Note that not all models will see every field, many are&nbsp;hidden as they are not relevant to the class/spec.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level: </strong>The target's level, all raid bosses (??) are considered 88. Heroics bosses are 87
</li><li><strong>Armor: </strong>The armor value that the target has. This is tied to the Level as it is standardized across all mobs of the same level.
</li><li><strong>Mob Type:</strong> The type of creature the target is. This affects some classes in which abilities they use.
</li><li><strong>Berserk Timer: </strong>The amount of time you have before the boss goes berserk and wipes the raid. This value will never be larger than 20 minutes and most are between 5 and 10 minutes.

<ul>
<li>Auriaya (Ulduar, T8)&nbsp;has to have every raid member in front of her or she performs AoE attacks that can potentially wipe the raid
