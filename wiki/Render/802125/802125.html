<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Rawr</h1>
Rawr is a program for comparing and exploring gear for Bears, Cats, Moonkin, Healadins, Retadins, Mages, DPS Warriors, Protection Warriors, Trees, Hunters, Protection Paladins, Healing Priests, Shadow Priests, Enhancement Shamans, Warlocks, Rogues, Restoration Shamans, Elementals, and DPS &amp; Tank Death Knights, in the MMORPG, World of Warcraft. Rawr has been designed from the start to be fun to use, and helpful in finding better combinations of gear, and what gear to obtain.<br />
<h1>Rawr Addon</h1>We now have a Rawr Official Addon for in-game exporting and importing of character data. The addon is hosted on Curse. The Addon does not perform calculations like Rawr, it simply shows your exported Rawr data in wow tooltips and lets you export your character to Rawr (including bag and bank items) like Character Profiler used to.<br /><a href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/rawr-official.aspx">http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/rawr-official.aspx</a><br />
