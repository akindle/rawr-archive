<ul><li><b><a name="LowerCalc"></a>Q: When I calculate Effective Health, Tank Points, or Burst Time manually, I come out with a number that is lower than what Rawr is calculating.  Why?</b>
<ul><li>A: ProtPaladin takes into account whether or not you are spec&#39;d into Ardent Defender, the talent that reduces the damage you take below 35% health.  This talent increases the amount of damage you can take, thus raising your Effective Health, Tank Points, and Burst Time by 8.75% if you have spent all 3 points on the talent.  Note that it does NOT model the self-resurrecting portion of Ardent Defender, only the damage reduction portion.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
