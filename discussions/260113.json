Let me start by complimenting all the wow team on a FANTASTIC job in making RAWR, its soo brilliant that i can live without my addons except for rawr, its that important to me. Now i have to say that since my toon cannot load from Battle.net\r\n i am in trouble and have been reduced to posting here for all to mock. I would like help in as simple as possible english (ho hum) on how i CAN import my toon into Rawr manually. Appart from the opening page on rawr which is a druid, i cant seem to find a\r\n tab that will allow me to change that to a Pala specc. Am i right?</p>\r\n<p>I have downloaded both Rawr 61082..and now what? Do i just leave it there or do i do more?</p>\r\n<p>I have downloaded Debug build..and now what? Do i just leave it there or do i do more?</p>\r\n<p>I have no toon saved what so ever except on the wow armory,&nbsp; can i still somehow get my toon from there into Rawr, if so how? *sob. Everytime i type &quot;/rawr export&quot; in wow i end up Roaring with bestial vigour!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can abuse, mock and riddicule me but please help somone who is asking for a guiding hand, loves the game and loves Rawr. Thanks</p>\r\n",
