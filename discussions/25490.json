Among my gear I have T4 Shoulders and Gloves. The T4 Shoulders have a +defence enchant.<br />When I try to optimize my gear for kitty dps, I can't seem to say that the T4 shoulders have the +defence enchant, and that my other shoulders have the +crit enchant. It's not an option to change enchant on my T4 shoulders, since I'm primarily a tank.<br />However, I wonder if it's still worth it to use the T4 Shouders with +defence enchant in order to get the set bonus.<br /><br />Almost same thing with gems. Here I want to select one item to use with the optimizer, but Rawr just wants to select all items with the same id (but with different gems) for optimization. I have some items gemmed with +stamina and +defence gems. I can't change gems on them, but still want to include them as possible items for kitty gear. <br /><br /><br />Where items come from<br />=====================<br />It would be nice to be able to use that information. For example, find upgrades for me from SSC (regardless of slot). Or find upgrades for me from everything except for BT/MH/Sunwell (one slot at a time, as Rawr normally works).<br /><br /><br />Fill sockets<br />==========<br />It would be nice to be able to remove all items with gems, but keep one of each item with empty sockets. I have 11 copies of Thunderheart Cover in Rawr right now...<br />Then be able to fill (and make copies as follows) (selection which to fill this time):<br />1) All sockets filled with this gem: select one gem and a meta gem.<br />2) Sockets filled according to color, with these gems (as Rawr works right now).<br />3) Add gemmed items I'm wearing right now.<br /><br /><br />Value of Stats<br />============<br />Show what one value of stamina, agility, AP, armor penetration, etc is worth to me.<br /><br /><br />Strange start<br />===========<br />When I started Rawr b13.1 I had copied my character xml-files from b12.1<br />When I started up Rawr the list view (right pane) was just a big red cross. No matter what I selected, it didn't work.<br />In the end I used Tools-&gt;Update Item Cache, and then restarted Rawr. After that everything seemed to work. <br />Bug?<br /><br />Those are my initial thoughts! <br />Keep up the good work!<br />",

The current way is very verbose, cluttered. However making many changes to the gem system has a ton of implications to it, and we could easily make it worse. So we won't be changing much with gemmings until we've got a really solid solution that everyone understands and finds easy. That said, a sort of mass delete and recreate specific gemmings wouldn't be out of the question, and could actually be quite viable... I'll see what I can do for next release.<br /><br /><div class=\"quote\" style=\"border: dotted .1em #aaa; border-left: none; border-right: none; font-style: italic; margin: 1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding: .2em;\"><br />Value of Stats<br />============<br />Show what one value of stamina, agility, AP, armor penetration, etc is worth to me.<br /><br /></div>There are charts for this for both bear and cat.<br /><br /><div class=\"quote\" style=\"border: dotted .1em #aaa; border-left: none; border-right: none; font-style: italic; margin: 1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding: .2em;\"><br />Strange start<br />===========<br />When I started Rawr b13.1 I had copied my character xml-files from b12.1<br />When I started up Rawr the list view (right pane) was just a big red cross.
