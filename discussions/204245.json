Rarw says to favor it over Mag' hari Chieftain's Staff, however on some bosses, the Val'kyr die very quickly due to raid wide damage and I worry that the other staff might be better. Is there a way to simulate this raid wide damage on pets, so I can analyze which staff is best for which fights?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, Ap.</p>",
