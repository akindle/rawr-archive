Might there be a way to incorporate an option to assume a full party of 5 with the Mother Bear talent, thus decreasing the mitigation cap and decreasing the value of the bonus armor on these items?<br>\r\n",

You can have 75% mitigation from armor, and then another 12% from Mother Bear, for a total of 78% mitigation. Then Blessing of Sanctuary / Grace stacks on top of that for a total of 78.66% mitigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: So yes, S4 is now best in slot or second best in slot (to sunwell items) for tanking.\r\n",
