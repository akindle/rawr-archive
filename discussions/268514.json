Not only do we have to update the calculations for Cata (it was still using Wrath calculations) but we also have to redo the way the system is designed (it had a LOT of redundant data floating around). Once we can get the damage numbers coming up correctly, we will start working on getting the rotation set up. But we need to make sure everything is working first.</p>",
