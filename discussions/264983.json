I would love to be able to check out gear upgrades and optimize my gear on my iPod at work (on\r\n break of corse), where I do not have rawr, so that I'm done when I get home. A web based app would be great for this or if it's not to big a downloadable version would be perfect. I know this would probably be a little difficult but I was just winding if there\r\n were any plans in the future for something like this. If there was another discussion about this, sorry didn't see it =P Thanks",
