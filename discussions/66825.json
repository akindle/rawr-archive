Testing (Squeeze) has v2.4.2.3 available, which I can use. There is a long list of bug fixes for v2.4.2.3 and I'd like to see if the bug that is mentioned in the quote is in that list.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>slopoke</p>",

There is a pretty easy fix, just to not use SetResolution on line 383-384 in ItemIcons.cs while on Mono. I commented it out and rebuilt it with MonoDevelop, and then Rawr would run just fine with Mono 2.4.</p>",
