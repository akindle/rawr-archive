The average crit added by Wrath is based on how much crit I've got without it, but you are already using formulas like that all over the place, so it shouldn't be too difficult to throw a % on there. ...Or should it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the real value I find in the trinket is in helping to counter &quot;dry spells&quot; which could kill a Vengeance stack rather than adding a flat crit %, but at least a flat % would move it up the list a bit.<br>\r\n",
