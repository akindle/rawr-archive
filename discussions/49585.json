This is mage model specific. I know this can be a real pain. I'm basically cheating when I'm doing heavy optimization and run from Visual Studio and just break in debugger and change next instruction to out of solver loop. I also use trace messages to show progress of the solver and this would be also useful to expose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll think about how to do it without interfering with other Rawr stuff.\r\n",
