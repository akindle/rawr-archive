Except Kavan's issue about upgrade values being shown in tooltips, but I think my issue is a little\r\n more general.</p>\r\n<p>Is the addon supposed to result in &quot;I'm an upgrade!&quot; or something similar appearing in tooltips for items OUTSIDE of the addon? Because mine doesn't.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Ti'tahk, the Steps of Time is a rather large upgrade for me, and in the addon it shows me, within the tooltip, where it drops. but in the Dungeon/Raid Handbook thingy, in chat links and in Atlas Loot, the tooltips are completely unaltered. Like,\r\n nothing. Not even where to find the darned thing.</p>\r\n<p>If you need more information from me, don't hestitate to ask :) I hope I can get this sorted, I've only just managed to get the addon to not crash when I import! :D</p>\r\n<p>- Fiamma</p>\r\n",
