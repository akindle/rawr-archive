When providing my Spec and Gear and chosing Backstab instead of Mutilate, my DPS increases by 500. When chosing Finishers, Eviscerate performs better than Envenom. When chosing a cycle the 4s/4r/4en Cycle is outperformed by 4s/5r/2en (which at least according to the EJ/Spreadsheet calculations shouldn't be the case)</p>\r\n<p>- Is it possible, that the weapon speed is not included in damage calculations? Rawr suggests me very slow Offhands and fast Mainhands in the higher ratings, which I kind of doubt would be correct.</p>\r\n<p>- When upgrading my gear it suggests putting my MH in OH slot, which I can't do, since I don't have it twice</p>\r\n<p>- Trinket Procs aren't included?</p>",
