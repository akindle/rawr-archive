    "Html": "The WotLK switch will be enabled in the b16 release, but it currently only includes the arcane talent changes. Also there are still many bugs on the beta server so it's hard to say which will stay in and which will be fixed. Right now the modeling is done as live on beta servers including the bugs. I think we may also be planning a release after b16 to cover specifically 3.0.2, but it's a bit too early to say what will be included. If anyone wants to help with updating and testing the frost/fire talents the help would be welcome as I'll be the first to admit that I don't play those :)\r\n",
