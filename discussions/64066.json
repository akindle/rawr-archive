The question of course is how are the racial, talent and buff multipliers combined to get the final value of the stat. For my specific case I'm looking at intellect on a gnome mage with Arcane Mind. The test gear has 1010 Intellect. The following are results as shown by ingame tooltip.</p>\r\n<p>5% Gnome, 15% Arcane Mind: 1441=222+1219</p>\r\n<p>5% Gnome, 6% Arcane Mind: 1328=204+1124</p>\r\n<p>5% Gnome, 6% Arcane Mind, Arcane Intellect (60): 1394=204+1190</p>\r\n<p>5% Gnome, 15% Arcane Mind, Arcane Intellect (60): 1514=222+1292</p>\r\n<p>5% Gnome, 15% Arcane Mind, Mark of the Wild (51): 1503=222+1281</p>\r\n<p>5% Gnome, 15% Arcane Mind, Mark of the Wild (51), Arcane Intellect (60), 10% Blessing of Kings: 1732=222+1510</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas are welcome while I put my mind to rest.</p>",
