I really don't understand  I'm sitting at about the same gear level as many of these mages and I just don't understand what settings in RAWR are causing this to happen and why it's valuing Haste so high or why it's going for this breakpoint. If the haste breakpoint was so vaulable why  wouldn't i see ANY other top fire mages going for it??</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gear level is 4 pc tier 12 heroic and 4 pc tier 13(1 LFR piece) goblin mage with staff, my armory is showing what RAWR is telling me to do with default setting on the latest update.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/nathrezim/Juanlopez/advanced\">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/nathrezim/Juanlopez/advanced</a></p>",
