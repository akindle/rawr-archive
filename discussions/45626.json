    "Html": "So the last time I played a mage, I made my own spreadsheet to evaluate gear. I've just hit 80 with my mage and switched to it as my main for raiding, and I decided to try out Rawr, but the numbers look like they are way off, rendering the program useless for my needs. Example:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRawr values Reanimator's Cloak (60 SP with socket and 35 int, 37 stam, 38 spirit) higher than Shroud of the Citadel (58 SP, 25 haste, 38 crit, 36 int, 42 stam)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just seems insane to me. How is Rawr actually valuing 38 spirit and 2 SP as more than 38 crit, 25 haste, 1 int and 5 stam? How can that be justified? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Rawr is valuing Insightful Earthsiege Diamond, which produces very little damage as the highest valued Meta gem. How can this be? I don't want mana regen, I want damage!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could list more examples, but really it just seems likeÂ these enough to highlight the problem I'm seeing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that since I've updated my gear, Shroud passed Reanimator's, but it's just barely and there is simply no point at which Reanimator's should ever be higher valued. \r\n",
