I then go and add a check to epic gems, and the gems in the items with the blue diamond now have their rare gems overridden\r\n with epic gems. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?</p>\r\n<p>Edit: Relaunched multiple times yesterday with same behavior. Since restarting my computer, it's not regemming the items in the gear list when I change the template, but when I hit Optimize (Override Regem NOT checked) the results have epic gems in the two\r\n items.</p>\r\n",
