I would really, really love an option for sorting/optimizing based on Survival + Mitigation while ignoring Threat. There are a number of fights (Thorim and Freya come to mind) where threat is simply never an issue, and I'd love to be able to examine and optimize pure incoming damage-related figures as a result.&nbsp; Mind you, I still enjoy the existing Survival and Mitigation split, so please don't get rid of that, I'm just interested in adding another option.</p>",
