    "Html": "After trying to find an answer to this at EJ, the Issue Tracker, and this forum, I still have no idea how Optimize is intended to be used. Although I love what Rawr is trying to do, I can't help but find the program itself incredibly unintuitive and clunky. Hopefully you guys will be able to get some better documentation up for newbs like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom these two issue tracker threads there seems to be a disconnect between the author and the users:<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=12309<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=12292<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issue: <br>\r\nTo optimize you should click the diamonds next to all the gear you currently have in your possession so it can find the best possible combination. However, this set of &quot;possessions&quot; always resets when you reload your character from the Armory. So you have to go back to &quot;Chart: Current Gear/Enchants/Buffs&quot; and manually check off each and every item you have once again...this is frustrating and annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, someone suggested that it automatically check off all the gear you have when you reload the armory. This makes total sense right? <strong>The armor you have equipped are obviously items you have &quot;available&quot;.</strong> However, Astrylian responds in this thread: http://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=12236<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<em><span style=\"display:inline-block;width:99%\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_CommentsRepeater_ctl00_MessageLabel\">&quot;Again, no. The\r\nmore items you have available, the slower and more inaccurate the\r\noptimizer is. Do *not* mark everything as available. Select only items\r\nwhich are potentially useful.&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></em><span style=\"display:inline-block;width:99%\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_CommentsRepeater_ctl00_MessageLabel\">Err...what? The guy is suggesting that all currently equipped gear imported from the Armory be auto-checked so that you don't have to do it every time. Also, it should SAVE all of the items you've ever checked even after reloading your character. I have about 7-8 trinkets in my bank that I have to look up every time I reload my character, just to add it to the &quot;available&quot; list so it's counted when optimizing. Can you please make it save your &quot;checks&quot; between sessions? And yes, I know there is a &quot;save character&quot; option. It still resets your checks every time you reload your character. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=12292\r\n",

Unfortunately this does not put a check (diamond) next to the enchants you already have or the gems you are already wearing but at least it saves you a lot of time.<br>\r\n",

That's a great suggestion, and is already done, and will be in the next version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB) Available items being 'reset' when reloading from the Armory, or re-opening your character, or really ever. This is a bug. I've heard of a few people encountering this, but I've never been able to reproduce it. Can anyone give more details about this bug? How do you make it 'reset' your available items? When you say reset, are we understanding the same thing (all available items are cleared; nothing is marked available)?<br>\r\n",
