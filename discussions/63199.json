But I think, in a field of&nbsp;optimization DK DPS I found a little mistake in&nbsp;this model. Changing my build slightly around&nbsp;Frost DPS, I found that moving some talent points into Toughness with 5/5 Bladed Armor selected, my AP doesn't change. Of couse, it's not critical, but when you lift your dps&nbsp;toward hardmodes, you want know how&nbsp;much dps you gain/lose due to such changes. May be it possible to fix this in a latest realises?</p>\r\n<p>With respect,</p>\r\n<p>Beathrix.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Assuming 15000 armor, 5/5 Toughness will net you 2250 additional armor. With 5/5 Bladed Armor, the additional armor will net you 62 ap. 62 ap for 5 talent points is perhaps a rather large waste of talent points, especially considering the amount of armor increase on new items is lacking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I am also of the belief that the additional armor from Toughness is considered bonus armor, and does not affect base armor calculations, thus negating any benefit from toughness from a DPS perspective. I'd be happy if anyone could correct me on this point.</p>",
