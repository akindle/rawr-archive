With only 10-man gear it's very gimpish to go for the 140k survival points, with all the stamina gear I have I just barely reach it. In Sartharion+2 during the first phase sartharion only breaths for about 7k in normal hits. Is the softcap really set for 25-mans or should there not be any difference?<br>\r\n",
