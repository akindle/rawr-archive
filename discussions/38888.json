I'd never had considered this to be a option before until I started playing around with gear on Rawr. After plugging in my new T6 shoulders I noticed Rawr was saying that T6 gloves would be a better option. And sure enough the bottom line increased from a overall 914 to a 923...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this correct or am I missing something here? Is a reduction of 5 mangle energy really gonna give a up by 9, considering a normal rotation of mangle,shred (4+), rip combo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks once again for such a great program... gets better all the time. Hope to see it for years to come good job guys.<br>\r\n",
