And that is not my problem.</p>\r\n<p>I have looked and looked, and i wasn't able to find any topic who was adressing my problem here.</p>\r\n<p>My problem is: why does rawr load my mage with all the buffs she normally have on a raidnight, and not on any other of my chars?</p>\r\n<p>I have tried to delete rawr and all rawr files, and re-install it many times, but its always the same; the buffs are there on my mage. Now im not complaining about it, because it always saves me some time,</p>\r\n<p>but im not sure if its intended from rawr.</p>",
