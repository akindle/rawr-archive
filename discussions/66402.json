However there is a mod called <a href=\"http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/talented.aspx\">Talented</a> that allows you to import &quot;templates directly from the Blizzard Talent calculator, wowhead or wowdb.&quot; So get a template set up in either one of those, install Talented. Go to your talent page (default keybound is to the letter &quot;n&quot;) and it will bring up your talent sheet with all three trees showing at the same time. in the first drop-down click &quot;import&quot; and paste in the url that the template you created.</p>\r\n<p>This mod also allows you to save templates that can be viewed on any alt you have.</p>",
