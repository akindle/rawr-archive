Im at 2700sp self buffed, yet the calculator claims i only do 2600dps. When i infact do roughly 4.3k</p>\r\n<p>There also seems to be some issues regarding the items, the values of a lot of items just seem flawed. Theres several items with less dps stats that are given a higher score than clearly better items.</p>\r\n<p>Example, Spectral seal of the prophet: 51sp is rated higher than Band of Guile: 50haste 59sp</p>\r\n<p>Crit, why is that stat valued so much? from what i see its rated a lot higher than haste.</p>\r\n<p>Why are some items given a negative score?</p>\r\n<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
