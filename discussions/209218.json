Do you think my rotation is to blame, or is it the same case for everyone?</p>\r\n<p>FYI, I am keeping Savage Roar, Mangle, Rip, and Rake&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">at all times</span>. (Rip and Rake being cast when Savage Roar is up of course)</p>\r\n<p>My only deviation from the optimal rotation that Rawr comes up with is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It recommends 4cp Savage Roar but I put Savage Roar based on the situation, varying from&nbsp;1cp to 5cp. When I try different 'SR combo points' on Rawr's&nbsp;custom rotation tab, I can see the projected DPS&nbsp;decreasing slightly (by few hundreds), but not that much.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>",
