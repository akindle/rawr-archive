When I mouse over the Spell Cycles asterisk in the Solution box, I get:<br /><br />Mana Potion: 2.07x<br />Mana Gem: 3.00x<br />Molten Fury<u>Heroism</u>Icy Veins<u>Serpent-Coil Braid</u>Icon of the Silver Crescent+Fireball: 9.84 sec<br />and the a whole bunch of lines with different combinations of the above followed by a number of seconds<br /><br />It seems clear that the solution is telling me that I need to use a couple pots and all three charges on my mana emerald. What I do not understand is remaining solution. It seems that the combinations are ordered in descending order of DPS, since the list ends with \"Fireball: 214.49 sec.\" But how do I take that information and turn it in to a linear timeline that shows me the best time to use various trinkets and abilities, which cooldowns to stack, whether to wait for IV and SCB to be synched or to use them separately, etc?<br /><br />By the way, thank you for all the great work that has gone into the Rawr project. It is a great asset for the WoW community.<br />",
