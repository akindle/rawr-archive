That way if you enable regemming/enchanting/forging options in optimizer it will only consider replacing gems with normal ones, but keep using them in the ones you already placed.</p>\r\n<p>And having one epic and one rare is perfectly doable. Just use the paperdoll and replace the gem individually, then it'll show up in the chart and you can mark it with blue.</p>",
