The whole damage system will be overhauled for cata anyway.</p>\r\n<p>The Rawr3 issue.<br>I can't do much here until I can get VS2010 operational, which is still some time away. (I pretty much ignored Rawr3 until now).<br>I can't even get the online rawr3 to run. The page loads to 100% then it shows an &quot;error on page&quot; in the statusbar.&nbsp; The error is '2007 an error has occured'.&nbsp; This doesn't seem to be in the issues. Want me to post it there ?</p>",
