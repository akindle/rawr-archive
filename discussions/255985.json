    "Html": "<p>The cycles are taken directly out of the Moonkin spreadsheet; so when it says \"MF Twice\", that means Moonfire sometime during Lunar proc and sometime during Solar proc.&nbsp; (General consensus is to apply them as soon as is practical after the proc, to take advantage of Nature's Grace.)&nbsp; WM is Wild Mushrooms, yes, and SF is Starfall.&nbsp; I apologize for the terse vocabulary, but tooltip space is limited.</p>\r\n<p>As for Sustained vs. Burst, this is covered elsewhere somewhere, but I'll explain it shortly.&nbsp; Burst DPS ignores mana considerations.&nbsp; Given that any moonkin in decent raid-level gear shouldn't be having mana problems, the two numbers _should_ be the same.&nbsp; However, for someone who just dinged 85 and is looking at 10- to 15-minute boss fights, mana will probably play a considerable role.</p>",
