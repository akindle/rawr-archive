The first couple of lines say something like Mana Potion: 1.7x Mana Gem: 2.1x etc.  It seems fairly obvious to me that rawr is telling me for the fight length I have selected those are the amount of consumables I should use.  The rest of the info is what is confusing to me.  It shows something like Combustion + IV + lust + drums +t rinket + fireball + etc....: 8.2 secs, followed by more lines of linked cooldowns and a time.  What exactly is it trying to tell me?<br />",
