I have an item I wish to sub into an equipment slot so as to view how much it changes my build though when I click on the item and search for the replacement item it doesn't appear in the list. I then right click edit to find the item and even though it shows in that list I am unable to insert it into the build I want. The Item in question is &quot;Enchanted Leather Sandals&quot; (Item code 30886). I previously was able to do this in earlier builds but today it appears evasive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks.\r\n",
