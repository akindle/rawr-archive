In the Gem list, it doesn't include anything like, &quot;Vivid Eye of Zul&quot; (my current issue), or Sovereign Dreadstone, and so I can't add them to my items to properly represent what I have. Is there any way I can add in a gem to the list of ones available? Could that be added in the future?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I can find the gem in the Item Editor, just can't figure out how to add it.</p>",
