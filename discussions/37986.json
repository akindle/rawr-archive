You're&nbsp;correct that frostbolt spam would maintain snare on snareable mobs, but right now I'm assuming that bosses aren't snareable. I'll probably add another option to set whether the target is snareable and if it's not set then only Slow cycles will count (which I don't have any implemented so far).\r\n",
