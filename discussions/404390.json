I fixed all referenced to them in my local copy, but rather decided to not commit this to the repository, since these changes are in other modules,\r\n potentially being managed by other devs.</p>\r\n<p>I don't think I broke or changed anything significant in those modules.</p>\r\n<p>Any objections if I do commit this to the Cat and Bear modules?</p>\r\n",
