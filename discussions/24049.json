    "Html": "\r\nI added in some of the resistance armor kits and head enchants with their correct spell IDs and slots, but the bear model does not appear to consider their stats \"useful\" and therefore refuses to display them in the drop-downs. Also, if I manually add this enchant to my gear in the character's saved XML file, they still aren't taken into consideration in caluculations, whereas resistance that is innate to gear is considered. Perhaps if I add 0.000001 stamina the Bear model will consider it useful and list it as an option. In the meantime, I'm adding the extra bonuses from the enchants directly to the items I'm considering.<br /><br />I'm assuming that the Nature Survival, Fire Survival, etc. complex stats refer to incoming spell damage, and not to incoming elemental melee damage. Elemental melee damage can crit but not crush, can be dodged or parried but not blocked, is not reduced by armor, is reduced by AP reducing abilities such as demoralizing roar/demoralizing shout, and is reduced by resistances at the same rate as spell damage.<br /><br />It might be useful for the Bear model to break up the complex stats into additional sections: Physical Melee Survival, Elemental Melee Survival, and Spell Survival.<br />",
