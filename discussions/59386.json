    "Html": "<p>Well the custom healing mode currently just assumes that you have an arbitrary rotation which has the casts you provided being used, and you use a SoL every chance you get (assuming your quota of flash heals hasn't been hit yet). One way of populating values for this is to just look at a WWS/WMO/WOL of a recent raid you've done and plug in relative frequencies of your spellcasts from there (taking care to account for multi-target casts correctly.</p>",
