Even if I change my font to 'normal' sized, alot of the buttons still overlap/etc .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI searched this section and found a reply stating that its a bug with windows forms which can't be fixed. The post was rather old though and some googling did show some possible solutions.<br>\r\nI wont link them here since I wouldn't want to pretend to know how to fix it, but I was hoping you could have another look at it, as I'm unable to use Rawr effectivly because of this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreetings<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "It is <em>possible</em> to 'fix' this, though fix doesn't really accurately describe the solution. Basically, you need to re-layout the UI of the whole app. For a complex app like Rawr, with tons of custom UI work, that's a sizable undertaking. The bottom line is that Windows' 'DPI' setting isn't a dpi setting at all; rather it's scalar on <em>some</em> UI elements like fonts, but not all, and is a seriously flawed design, leaving only the most basic, high profile, and built-in programs to support it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe strongly suggest that you fix your DPI settings, by going to Display Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; DPI, and setting it to Normal. Not just for using Rawr, but for using anything.<br>\r\n",
