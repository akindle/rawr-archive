There is no Grey background no loading percentage in the middle, nothing. I have tried it on Chrome and IE 32-bit. I have reloaded the page\r\n many times, deleted cookies/cashe, reinstalled silverlight many times, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Update: It loaded for me once at random. I havent been able to do it since.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n<p>Sky.</p>\r\n",
