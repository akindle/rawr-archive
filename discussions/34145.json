    "Html": "What I love about RAWR is that it is possible to download the data and gear from the Armory and gain access to an awesome set of tools for data mining and future planning within that spec. However, should one wish to look into changing spec and jumping over to another role, then things get complicated as each model has a different method of altering the talent data that is downloaded from the Armory. In the Tree model you can select from 8 different talents, whereas the Moonkin model has talents from all 3 trees. Is there any way that models within a class could be standardised on one format of displaying these talents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacha<br>\r\n",
