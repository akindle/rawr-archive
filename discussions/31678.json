I've fixed most of the things, but I need some reports from those using the dev builds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor best performance I suggest disabling automatic armor and manually selecting it under buffs, enabling global optimizations and segment cooldowns and integral mana consumables for display. The expected working range is for up to 6 min fights, but up to 10 min should work also if you're prepared to wait about a minute to get the solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm looking for xml files where sequence reconstruction gets a score below 100. If you have any just open a new issue here and I'll take a look at it. Some things that I know aren't working yet are drums of battle and serpent-coil braid, so reports that don't use these should have a priority since I probably don't know that they're broken.\r\n",
