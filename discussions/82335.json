I play a raid healing Disc priest and Im prone to casting bubblesP penances and flash heals.  I already have enough haste to reduce Flash heal to 1 sec.  So why does Rawr show tht some BiS pieces for me have pure haste on them?  What about the crit piece right below it?  Can anybody shed some light on this?",
