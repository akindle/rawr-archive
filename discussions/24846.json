In general though, more processing power will give you more performance. It should take just a couple minutes.<br />",

    "Html": "\r\nI'm running 12.1, so my comments are given in that context...<br /><br />Right now Rawr separates gear from enchants, and that works really well. I enter what enchants I have, and I compare gear given that I will enchant the future gear in the same way.<br /><br />However, having Rawr compare all gear I have will cause some issues.<br /><br />For instance:<br />I have some pieces of T4 gear. Really nice. But since I'm in raids to tank I have them enchanted with +defence, +stamina and stuff like that.<br />When finding the best set of gear for dps though, I will most likely still want to include two pieces of T4 for the wonderful set bonus. <br />So, in essence I want to compare one shoulder piece with +defence enchant against another shoulder piece with +crit enchant.<br /><br />That leads to Rawr needing to track enchants per item and not per item slot, and I guess that will mean a major change for Rawr. <br /><br />Gems are tracked per item, perhaps it's needed to do the same with enchants. And then have the Enchant tab be the default...?<br /><br />I'm sure you have better ideas that I do, but I thought I'd post my worries here.<br />",

Right now I have several duplicates of every item just to represent one item with different gems. Adding enchants in the same way will make double of tripple the amount of duplicates, and will make it harder to read lists and choose items since the lists will be so long...<br />",
