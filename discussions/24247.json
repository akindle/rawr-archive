What i don't understand is why do i have to check this twice (first equip it, and then check the box in temporary buffs), isn't the temporary buff taken into consideration as soon as i equip the idol (along with it's proc rate)? <br /><br />Another question would be how to compare the idols (i want to compare it with idol of feral shadows/ everbloom idol)? Should i evaluate idol of terror with or without the buff checkbox on? And what's the point in having this checkbox when other idols are equipped?<br /><br />Is there anything i'm missing here?<br /><br />Cheers<br />",
