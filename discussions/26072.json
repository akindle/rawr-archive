For instance, every item I have in my inventory has a cost of 0.  Each item in the heavy clefthoof set I could assign a cost of 1, because while I might not have them, I can always buy them.  An item that costs 100 badges I could assign a cost of 3 and an T5 item I could assign a cost of 10, depending on the likelyhood I'll be able to acquire it.  The optimizer could then have additional rules involving the cost (i.e. no item costing more than 0 to use only what I have, total cost of changes not to exceed 5 and so on)<br />",
