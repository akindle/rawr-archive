When i toggle the option on the debuffs menu, the dps for nearly all the talent builds goes up except for deep frost and 10/48/3 fire mages which don't change at all. <br />",

Selecting it in the buffs means that someone else is providing the buff if you don't have it. So if you select it in frost spec it won't increase dps since it is already included.<br />",
