I suggest handling gems in a manner similar to enchantments.  Have an additional tab that lets you select dropdown gem combinations from all the possible gems.  Rather than force the optimizer to either assume every player has access to every gem or to only allow access to known gems, you could have an additional screen that lists gems and lets you check off which ones you have available to you (or think you could easily acquire).  <br />",
