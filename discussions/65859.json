    "Html": "<p>Thank you for the quick response, is there anyway to adjust the expertise cap without affecting the hit cap? As a Ret Pally should never really be in front of the target therefore that would bring the cap to 214 expertise rating (26 expertise, 6.5%). From what i am understanding its all built into one where if I change the Melee Avoid then that will effect the hit cap as well. This would explain why it is unable to Optimize my results for Melee Avoid % &lt;= 0 when I clearly am reaching the hit cap and the expertise cap for being behind a targ @ 83. Thanks again.</p>",

However, I do not suggest for any model to blatently state that you are behind the mob 100% of the time as most fights involve movement and you cannot guarantee being behind the mob 100% of the time. I personally use 75% time in back as it's a decent average amongst most boss fights.</p>\r\n<p>However, I just noticed something else. If you are nice and capped the result of the function is 1, which is being multiplied by 100 (to handle the percentage translation). So in the Optimizer, the requirement that you want to set, with the way the code is currently written, is 'Melee Avoid % &gt;= 100' which means your attacks land 100% of the time.</p>\r\n<p>Since this is counter-intuitive and backwards from how other models are doing it, I can change it to function differently and break out the values in case someone (though there's no reason to) wants to just make themselves hit capped and skip expertise, etc.</p>",
