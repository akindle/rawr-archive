But when I look at the breakdown for the spammed flamestrike damage I get 1430 Dot damage for a cookie-cutter ttw-firemage with about 2200 SP. What's that number supposed to be? It's way too high for a tick and way too low for the total dot Damage. Can someone shed some light on this, please?</p>",

Hmmm: 0,5*2200+780=1880. And that's before multipling with the firepower etc. And like I said, Rawr shows only about 1400 dot damage. Maybe someone messed up the coeffecient for one tick with the coeffecient for the entire dot?",
