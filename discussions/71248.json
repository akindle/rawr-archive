I have found</p>\r\n<p>myself in many a situation where i would like to have the optimiser check my gear for say 500 haste but it usually responds</p>\r\n<p>with 200-300. I dont know if it would be viable to do, but it would really give us locks ALOT more versatility when using the app.</p>\r\n<p>I have seen Hit Rating being availble at the moment, and thought it might not be to difficult to ask for Haste and/or Crit as well&nbsp;:)</p>\r\n<p>Thx for the great app again and all the effort u guys put into it!</p>",

We want optimizable requirements to be for things that actually matter to your performance; ie, Miss %, instead of HitRating. If there's a situation where Haste % actually matters (and I would guess that there is, such as CCing), that'd be a perfectly valid optimizable requirement.&nbsp;</p>",

I think thats low, im never in the top 10 dps list, and i think that haste has something to do with it. Im seeing alot of warlocks out there who tops everything, and they have lots of haste so i think it would be an important factor to implement in the optimizer.</p>",
