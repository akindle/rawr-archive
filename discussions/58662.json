    "Html": "<p>mono is not an application per se. it doesnt behave the way most mac friendly programs do. the way to access mono after install is to use the terminal app. its kinda tricky to get the hang of because it is a command line interface (think of dos), but if you launch terminal the mono framework is built right in (assuming you installed it :P). now if you would like to get rawr running like a mac friendly application, ie an icon you can click on, run the script i posted above in terminal. first you must navigate to the rawr directory using the cd command. for instance you type &quot;cd users&quot; &quot;cd desktop&quot; &quot;cd rawr&quot;. thats where mine is, yours might be somewhere else, you can always type &quot;ls&quot; if you get lost. (that is LS, not to be confused with IS). and dont forget to add the -r:Data like i did. it will take a few minutes to compile depending on the speed of you machine. beware though, running rawr under mono is SLOOOOOOWWWWWWW and somewhat buggy. the buggieness isnt too bad though. hope that helped.</p>",
