I believe ProtWarr and ProtPaladin allow you to change the mitigation scalar, and setting them to 1x may make them be on the same scale as each other, and bear, but I'm not positive off-hand.</p>\r\n<p>No matter what though, you won't be able to make fine grain comparisons, you'll only be able to make generalizations like &quot;A is way better geared than B&quot;.</p>",
