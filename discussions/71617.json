However, after I tried added constraints in the optimising tool of low chances to miss and dodge (i.e. trying to keep to hit and expertise caps), it has an annoying tendancy to prefer to dual wield Titanguard instead of wielding a shield. I would have thought always using shields was pretty much a given. I can't see an option anywhere to force this behaviour.</p>\r\n<p>Was using % miss &lt;=0,</p>\r\n<p>% to be dodged &lt;= 0</p>\r\n<p>(although values of 0.5 also did the same thing).</p>\r\n<p>Okay, so my shield is slightly outdated... but until I find an upgrade, I'd rather keep hold of it!</p>\r\n<p>Current numbers it is showing me:</p>\r\n<p>With a hit rating of 205 (+6.25% extra hit), it lists me missing with 10.09% of my attacks. It seems to be&nbsp;incurring a dual wield hit penalty from somewhere. Equipping a second weapon in that slot doesn't drop the % of missed attacks.</p>",
