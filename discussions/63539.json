Finally I got around to asking people for random buffs to figure out what was missing, and I figured out that Kitty buffs do not include the Health section that the Bear section has (this includes Blood Pact/Imporved Imp and Commanding Shout/Commanding Presence (Health)). What was happening was that RAWR was saying that with raid buffs, I would have 24,017 in Kitty (in actuality it is 24,007 [which I can deduce that there is a rounding issue but really it doesn't matter]). However with full raid buffs, including Commanding Shout (which is what I generally would have), I generally had 26,196. After going through RAWR.CAT, you guys do not include that buff. Now I understand RAWR.Cat is all about figuring out DPS, but it would be useful to figure out total possible health.</p>",
