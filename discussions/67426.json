An export talent would be nice too; I use Talented which can take URLs for talent builds and set them up as templates. I just finished working on my bear, and am trying to work on my cat, but either character profiler doesn't pull secondary specs, or I don't know how to convince it to show them... There is a 'cat' in the dropdown for my second talent spec, but it's not the one I'm using. I know I can set them manually, but it would be nice if I could just export from Talented and import...</p>",
