Personally I scale threat way down. I still end up with plenty of threat.<br>\r\nSo far I've come across gear that has lots and lots of stamina. I have a massive amount of HP, but a rather mediocre mitigation. What I'd like now is to be able to scale down the importance of survivability and scale up the importance of mitigation - and I can't find that possibility in Rawr anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently I'm using Relative Stat values and scale up agility, defence, dodge and armor manually by about 20%, and then use those values to compare items. Seems like a bad way to use Rawr, but I desperately need more mitigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould we please have a setting like &quot;Threat Value&quot;, but that scales survivability and mitigation.<br>\r\n",
