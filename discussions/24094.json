What does this option specify, exactly? Is it just to estimate how much of your damage is in Molten Fury range, which may not actually be 20% but possibly more like 15% due to whatever reason(s)? Can someone clarify?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />-Morg<br />",

If raid DPS were constant, it'd be 0.2, but most likely you'll burn heroisms during this range, and plus you fire mages and warriors do more damage while in this range, so the default is 0.15. That all sound right, Kavan?<br />",
