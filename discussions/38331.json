Maybe for the next extension of WoW ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you need help for the French language, I think that I shall have the time (everything depends when you will make it) to make it for you, if you wish it. English is not ma natural language, but I think it's not serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRawr is more and more known through the players of the whole world, and I think that to bring a translation would return&nbsp; the application more user-friendly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, thank you very much for Rawr ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrhondril\r\n",
