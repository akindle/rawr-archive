Can rawr be used for disc priests and is it accurate when doing so? Also when I want to use the optimize feature should I base it on the overall rating, hps burst rating, or hps sustained rating?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",

Also make sure you set all options to be as close as possible to the situation you wish to optimize for. Then you should optimize for overall rating.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>",
