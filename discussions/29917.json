You're saying you get resto shaman, I'm not exactly sure, but I think there was no option for mana tide in 14.1, so unless you're using a dev build it might not be completely accurate. Just check what consumables Rawr is estimating that you'd need and compare with your ingame situation. If you can get through with considerably less consumables than Rawr is suggesting you might have to reevaluate your parameters. Either you'll have to increase mana income (you could simulate mana tide through shadow priest mp5 if you don't have the latest version) or you'll have to examine if dps uptime parameter matches in game situation. However if the mana situation is estimated correctly you can safely regem for damage instead of haste.\r\n",
