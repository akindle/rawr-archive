We're thinking something like the tips on the loading screens in WoW, that sort of thing.<div><br></div><div> &quot;You can save talent builds by clicking the Save button, and then compare different builds in the Talent Specs chart.&quot;</div><div> &quot;You can use the All Buffs chart to find the best food, elixir, or flask for your character.&quot;</div><div> &quot;By marking the green diamond next to items, gems, and enchants, you indicate that you have them available to you. The Optimizer can use that information to find the best set of gear available to you, or to build a list of potential upgrades for you, and their upgrade values.&quot;</div><div> &quot;When using the Optimizer, you can use the Additional Constraints feature to enforce requirements such as being uncrittable, being hit capped, maintaining a certain level of survivability, a minimum haste %, and much much more.&quot;<br><div> </div><div>Everyone, please contribute your own ideas! </div></div>",
