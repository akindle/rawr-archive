    "Html": "Yeah so is the 3.0.4 armor mode working properly because items that are getting their armor multiplier removed (necks, e.c.t) are still ranking higher than items i think would be better. For example, Rawr is saying that the &quot;Amulet of Autopsy&quot; (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39246) is better than &quot;Heritage&quot; (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40069). I could be wrong but this really doesn't seem right. Can someone explain this to me?\r\n",
