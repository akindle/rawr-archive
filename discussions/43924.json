I really dont understand why rawr favours Agi that much over Stam. In the last build, i got nearly the perfect gear, excluding 1 oder 2 items. Now Stam got nearly the worst stat in your calculations, and i wonder why. My <strong>Figurine - Monarch Crab</strong> with one 24 Stam and one 41 Stam JC gem now is the ~20th Trinket in the list. Its even worse than Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch. I am calculation raidbuffed, with the standard 140000 Soft Cap, which should be the value for &quot;the hardest hitting bosses&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo please, tell me, why is Stamina that worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for help (and sorry for my non-native english).<br>\r\n",
