    "Html": "Something that struck me when I first used RAWR, and immediately struck my friend who tried it for the first time last night - there doesn't seem to be any indication of armour type (cloth/leather/mail/plate) and there doesn't seem to be a way to filter based on armour type. It was particularly noticeable when using the healadin model because a lot of the upgrades in the optimizer were cloth healing gear. While cloth is obviously an option it'd be great if there was a way to filter out all the cloth items without manually going through and deleting each item. Even including the armour type in the tooltip would be a big help because at a glance there is no way to tell what type of armour it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I missing the option to filter armour types, or is it not included? And if it's the latter is there any chance of adding the feature? It'd be greatly appreciated.<br>\r\n",
