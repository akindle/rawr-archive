I have the option checked to import everything..(equipped, bags, bank). All it shows is what I have equipped and then items that\r\n are greatly superior to what I have equipped. I haven't played wow since WOLK so i would think that some of the quest items I&nbsp;acquire&nbsp;would be marginaly better than the gear i currently have equipped. I also have all of the filters checked. Is there\r\n something&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;missing?</p>\r\n",
