I've also been suggested to replace my T7.5 gloves with T8 gloves, even though this resultsin sizable loss of DPS due to losing the T7 4pc bonus. And other random whackiness with regemming suggesting I regem gear to meet socket bonuses, and then once that optimization has been selected, it will resuggest the former.</p>",
