For example when you got 4 Piece bonus, you can not tag 2 Piece bonus from another regalia, and I am looking for a way to pass that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>EDIT: hmm actually I added Khadgra's Regalia 2 Piece Bonus by editing one item. Should it work that way?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n<p>-runtu</p>",

    "Html": "<p>The set bonuses under buffs should not be selectable. If Rawr sees the you have 2 or 4 pieces of an implemented set then it automatically applies the buff. You should not have to edit items to get the set bonus buff to activate. If you are having to do this, please post an issue along with copy of your toon. If your bonus is not on the list, it may not be implemented and again , post issue and toon in issue tracker once you check to see that there is not already a previous (open or closed)&nbsp;issue on that particular buff</p>\r\n<p>Along the same lines be careful; sometimes the 2 pieces bonuses from each tier (9 and 10) can often be better than the 2 and 4 piece bonuses from a single tier (Hunter is a good example of this).</p>",
