The workaround for now is to equip it on your character in game, log out, check the Armory to make sure the official armory profile has updated, then load your character from armory - which should work as long as it's not an item with a weird not-seen-before mechanic - but that's why it's a closed beta so we can give feedback and get stuff talked about!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
