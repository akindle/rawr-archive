I'm just wondering cause I think that would solve alot of the issue on having to code in the %'s and making them reflect the right value\r\n in game and on Rawr, and would make it so player would actually have to research their toons more helping to get rid of BADDIES from all the servers. at least that's what I would hope to happen? Players know their %'s and getting them right would help alot\r\n of us pull the maximum DPS, and or making tanks hold aggro better and bring their survivability up to the proper level... What do you guys think about this? Cause I Use RAWR every time I get a new piece of gear to help me always be great with my stats and\r\n it works out for my benefit but I really what to know if this would be a good and serious change your guys can make?</p>\r\n",
