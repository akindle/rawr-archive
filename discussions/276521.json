Is there anything I can to to make this not take so long, like disable some feature that is no longer supported? I was also having trouble getting\r\n the item icons to work but i&nbsp;realized&nbsp;that some pictures were missing from the file. However, I cannot get the talent images to work (I have found the images in a folder but they aren't being used. All i see in the program is some creepy face :S).\r\n Obviously not asking for any development on an outdated program version, but if someone could point me in the right direction of fixing these things myself I would greatly appreciate it.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>-Upgrayedd</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
