However, when using progressive Optimize (and having this set be the highest weighted, first set to examine), not a single Emblem of Frost gear is suggested.  For ANY of the sets.\r\n\r\nIf I use the Bath Tools Optimize function instead of optimizing it via the main Rawr window, it likewise does not show me a single piece of gear that I could obtain with my specified Cost settings.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?  I like the cost feature and, given my usage, I might be able to work around it by first manually optimizing my primary set and then using progressive optimize, but I would prefer to do all my work straight from the Bath Tools window.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nOmichron",
