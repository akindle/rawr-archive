The thing is that there seems to be no &quot;standard&quot; for the names used for summary stats. Some use &quot;Burst DPS&quot; while in a nother model is called &quot;DPS-Burst&quot; and such. Also, why for all melee classes the sumarry stats are not the same? Some track DPS and others DPS and Survailability.</p>\r\n<p>I just wish you could make names more standard and similar for similar specs.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Foam</p>",
