Say for Sunday 3rd Jan 2010?</p>\r\n<p>Can I also suggest that we look at the idea of having a fortnightly release of Rawr so we get new fixes out to users more frequently. Sunday releases seem to suit Astrylian so perhaps every second Sunday? It may also be a good idea to have a more frequent Rawr 3 updates too so that we can really get this up to speed and aim to have a general release at some point in 2010 :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Oh and Happy New Year to you all, it's already 2010 here and coming to the east coast of the US in just under 85 minutes.</p>",
