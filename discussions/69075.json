Seems the calculated dps makes more sense as well and the gear optimizer finally gives advice I can understand and might even follow. So far for the positive things. Now for the gear upgrade option. I must say that the advice given there seems to be totally ridiculous. Crafted blues and blue quest rewards are rated higher than level 226+ epics?</p>\r\n<p>For instance with neck pieces:</p>\r\n<p>Choker of the Betrayer: 49,31 (level 171 blue)<br>Emerald Choker: 28,51 (level 200 blue)<br>Amulet of Truesight: 21.06 (level 34!!!! blue)<br>Evoker's Charm: 20,11 (level 226 epic)</p>\r\n<p>Unless I've seriously screwed up settings this must surely be a mistake.</p>\r\n<p>Onyx.</p>",
