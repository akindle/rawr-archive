Now I was reading up on Microsoft's Silverlight website and got the idea that it can be used not only for web usage, but also for platform usage. Earlier this week you guys started implementing Silverlight into RAWR 3.0 in the source code and I was wonderign where you are heading with the program? Are you trying to implement a more video presentation into RAWR (ie: 3D model of your character) or are you trying to implement RAWR onto the web?</p>",

(The last two are only subtly different, and we'll get into that more when we get there). We have no plans for 3D modeling at the moment.</p>",
