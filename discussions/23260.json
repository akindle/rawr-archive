Creating a new splash screen has been on my mind from the day I first looked at Rawr, and today I finally got a little time for it. See if you prefer this to the current one -<br />http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/6809/rawrsplashac6.jpg<br /><br />The class icons at the bottom are for classes that have been modeled and I grouped the names of multiple specs under one class.<br />",

Instead of the names of people (because so many people contribute to Rawr, but aren't in charge of a model,and the # of people on a model could get large), I'd say we just display the name and version # under each icon, and remove my name from the upper right. Did you make that graphic in the middle? It's neat!<br />",
