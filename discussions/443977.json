They site that the model maintained: never at the bottom right after you load a mage shows it is not working.  I see in your version notes you have posted all of the spec updates.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, Is it functional?<br />\n\r<br />\nAnd if it is...is there still an issue with Cha Ye's trinket for mages?<br />\n",
