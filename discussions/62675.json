This got tedious after the dozenth time of swapping so I commited myself to finding a way to make this simpler. Today I found it.</p>\r\n<p>Make 2 new macros named ActDPS and ActDef and give them the ? icon.</p>\r\n<p>Give them the following Macro Text</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>#showtooltip<br>/cast Battle Stance<br>/script EquipSet(<span style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;DPS&quot;</span>)<br>/usetalents 2<br></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>and then</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>#showtooltip<br>/cast Defensive Stance<br>/script EquipSet(<span style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;Prot&quot;</span>)<br>/usetalents 1<br></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Change the 1/2 to whichever talent spec you have set to that group.</p>\r\n<p>Now, with one click of a button you can change completely from one thing to the other, no sweat. (Note that you cannot change gear or talents in combat)</p>",
