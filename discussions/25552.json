I was able to add steelweave to my cloak by coping the one I had and just giving it 12 more def.<br /><br />Thank you so much for the work you have done.<br />",

With the ability to edit you can toss in different gems than the predefined and not have to have 20 variations in the selection lists (although you can if you want) it's that flexibility that is really great.<br /><br />Thanks for the reply. I only wish I knew more about the languages you are using so I could contribute more.<br />",
