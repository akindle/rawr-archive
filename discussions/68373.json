    "Html": "<p>hi,</p>\r\n<p>great !....&nbsp; amazing coincidence is a sign .... I'm sure you'll be successfull&nbsp; (sorry for my english ... I'm a french frog ....).&nbsp; anyway, Rawr is a very good tool to be achevied and I understand that it's not easy specially in spell rotation because Warlock use more than 3 casts and also for glyph like &quot;connexion&quot; or &quot;chaos&quot; because fight time have to be included and that is very hard to do in case of main Affliction talents.&nbsp; Do you take into account &quot;real spirit&quot; to calculate spell bonus for &quot;spell armor&quot; and bonus critik % ?&nbsp;Also I noted something difficult to take into account for stuff and&nbsp;gemming comparison: I mean the &quot;cap&quot; ( in french use )&nbsp;that is&nbsp;the maximum % to be calculated with the stuff regarding &quot;haste&quot; &quot;hit&quot; &quot;critik&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp; For example : if you are &quot;cap&quot; for hit, a good ring with &quot;hit&quot; won't give you a bonus and a ring with &quot;haste&quot; will be more profitable.&nbsp; A lot of fascinating work in perspective !!</p>",
