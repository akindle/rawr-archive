All of them have diffrent professions. I can go with my main anywhere, one of my alts is rdy for Naxx 25man when other 2 still better stay in Naxx10. So everytime I load my main char I have to enabled loot from all instances and all emblems but when I load one of my alts I have to unclick lots of of filters so I dont see loot from Ulduar as I wont ever go there</p>",

If we decide to implement this it would probably not be a default, but as an option to save filters with the character.</p>",

I have a Resto/Boom druid who carries 3 complete sets of Gear.&nbsp;A Resto set, a Raid boomkin set and a Heroics Boomkin set(lvl 82 boss). I currently have 3 different files to try to keep updated on this toon, and have to manually add gear to each one to check for usefullness..and try to swap between each one during a raid to figure out if it will in fact be an upgrade to any of my &quot;roles&quot;. I.E. while raiding Boomkin, i will have the Raid Boomkin optimized one loaded, but if a &quot;healing&quot; piece drops, i would like to know if it is an upgrade for offspec rolls.</p>\r\n<p>For guild runs it is not an issue to save out and reload the toon in most cases, but when in a PUG the roll calls are often to fast to get it done.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks a ton for all the work on the project</p>",
