Only formula for lvl 80 seems to be correct one (resist/K+resist; K being 400 for level 80 and 510 for level 83 or boss mobs).</p>\r\n<p>It would be great if formula used to calculate average resist on target was corrected. As it is now, according to Rawr, against level 80 mobs I resist on average 15.79% of damage from schools affected by improved mark of the wild 75 resistance, but against bosses this goes up to 21.79% when it should go down to 12.82% according to formula.</p>\r\n<p>Edit: This is on druid bear module of Rawr, I have checked warrior module which does not seem to show same behavior but I also noticed one other stuff missing in druid calculation. It also does not seem to take in account talent protector of the pack here as 12% reduction in damage from it is not increasing average resistance or survival effective health for resistance tanking unlike defensive stance for warrior.</p>",
