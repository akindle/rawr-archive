(Also realised I had previously made a change in terms of reforging graphs, which I had never committed. Managed to commit it now for Rawr4.\r\n If useful, we can add it to Rawr5 as well.).</p>\r\n<p>I tried a complete checkout and had some issues:</p>\r\n<p>Rawr4.3 didn't compile since it seemed to miss Rawr.Moonkin\\ProcEffect.cs. I still had an old working copy and managed to locate the file there.</p>\r\n<p>Rawr5 doesn't compile. It complains about Rawr.Base\\Networking\\ElitistArmoryService.cs and again the Moonkin ProcEffects files. Again tried to copy the old source file, but it seems there where a bunch of changes and ElitistArmoryService is trying to modify\r\n values that are now read-only.</p>\r\n<p>Is it just my checkout or are we missing some files in the repository?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
