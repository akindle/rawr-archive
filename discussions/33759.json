I would like any feedback you could give about any bugs and features you would like to see. Since I have sort of been out of the WoW loop for a few months.Â Tankadin I never really finished and is very buggy/not correct, mainly with threat, and wasn't really meant to be released in its current form.",

For the tankadin model, if it hasn't been suggested already, is to have some sort of a slider or something to add the defense from anticipation, much like the option in retribution to add the talent precision to the hit rating. Hopefully this isn't in place and I somehow missed it. Also, it was showing 493 defense as being .48% chance to be crit?<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "From EJ:<br>\r\nI played around with the Tankadin model for the first time today, and\r\nwhile it's a good start, there's still a lot to be done. Here are my\r\ninitial impressions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Balance between mitigation, survival, and threat components in\r\nsignificantly unbalanced to the point where the &quot;overall&quot; ranking is\r\nnot meaningful. That affects all slots, but is particularly notable in\r\nthe neck, ring, and back slots, where you have to scroll way down to\r\nfind tanking options as the top choices are spell damage pieces.\r\nIdeally people should be able to alter the relative weights of threat,\r\nmitigation, and survival, but certainly the default weighting of threat\r\nneeds to be turned way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Hit, Expertise, and Spell Hit currently have no effect of threat in\r\nthe model....these stats do play a role in Tankadin threat, especially\r\nExpertise at late-game gear levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- The mitigation/survival terminology is not something I'm used to\r\nseeing. Typically in the Tankadin community the division is expressed\r\nin terms of mitigation (effective health related, e.g. stam, armor,\r\nblock value) and avoidance (miss/dodge/parry). If you want to use the\r\nexisting terms to be consistent with other modules, the tooltips should\r\nexplain at least roughly what the terms mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- TPS calculations look to be on the low side, though I haven't dug\r\ninto this in detail yet. At a minimum, it's not taking into account the\r\nthreat gains you&quot;ll get from the mana returns on Spiritual attunement.<br>\r\n",

Those sliders and the armor slider should\r\nbe changed to just text boxes though I think because there are too many\r\nvalues to select one precisely, and this is especially needed when it\r\ncomes to armor. Also, the Threat slider scales from 1 to 1000, but the\r\ndefault setting of 100 is already way too high, so that variable should\r\nbe rescaled.<br>\r\n",
