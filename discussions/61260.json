I used charater profiler to transfer my equiped and banked items into rawr. I have deliberately not enchanted any items prior to importing them as I wanted to see what RAWR suggested. I noticed that the diamond box next to each item had&nbsp;a red dot next to it which I assume means it is limiting the options for enchants. I went through each item and under the right click option I selected ANY enchant for all the items I have in my bank / equiped. I dont recall having to do this when I have used this program in the past, and it was quite annoying.</p>\r\n<p>I then ran an optimisation of my current gear, and for some reason it didn't suggest any enchants. I have run multiple optimisations, with override regem / override reenchant box checked and unchecked. Each time it doesn't alter any of the enchant options. I have gone through and manually selected enchants that I thought would be useful and rerun the optimisation. However it returns suggestions with most of the items unenchanted.</p>\r\n<p>Am I missing something here?</p>\r\n<p>As I have said I haven't had these troubles previously with this fantastic program</p>",
