I know you just had thanksgiving and its the &quot;holiday season&quot; but surely they would be expected their staff to do some work between now and Xmas? If they left it later it would be tight for Xmas and so delayed into January.</p>\r\n<p>This way they can lock the gate on the second part until Jan 5th or 12th, and have a month of first 4 bosses which will be a pretty slack month anyway. That in itself should limit the issues arising until after the staff are back in normal routines in Jan. We'd then have a few weeks on second part taking us into late Jan/early Feb, when they open up the last bit they have coded. I'd also expect a new PTR at that point ie: late Jan/early Feb to test the final bosses including Arthas himself. I'd then expect that patch to go live early March.</p>",
