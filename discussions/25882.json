So I'd be realy glad to have an option to change this.<br />e.g.<br />I'm mage, so I'll take some caster stats<br /><br />Spell-haste vs spell-dmg vs spell-crit  etc pp....<br />In what relations to each other do you calculate with them? 1,15 vs 1,0 vs 0,65?<br />",

It is 11.7 spell damage, 10 for ratings and 4 mp5.<br /><br />If however you're thinking of dmg equivalence values it does not use fixed relations. It computes the total damage done with the given stats and options. The chart it shows is dynamic, as you change the gear and options the values of different ratings change also.<br />",

It won't be much use to use unless you  can read C# however.  <br />",
