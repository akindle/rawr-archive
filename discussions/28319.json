I started looking at the gems, and I saw something that I didn't quite understand.<br>\r\nAccording to this newest version, the +int gems (+10 int is the epic version, +8 int is the blue version), were rating higher DPS than the +spell damage gems (+12 is the epic, +9 is the blue).&nbsp; Now, before I post this as an issue, I wanted to make sure there wasn't any logic I was missing. My previous view has always been:&nbsp; Spell Hit(until capped)&gt;Spell haste&gt;Spell Damage&gt;Spell Crit&gt;MP5/Spell Pene/Int/etc. (for fire, at least).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything that I was missing before I posted this in the Issue Tracker.<br>\r\nThanks in advance.<br>\r\n",
