It's what makes it really work. Even making no changes and running it twice in a row you can end up with different results.</p>\r\n<p>The most likely thing from what you stated, is #1: that you equipped Heroes Dreamwalker Vestments but then didn't add the Green Diamond, which the Optimizer/Build Upgrade List needs. Without that green diamond it doesn't realize that that item is available to wear.</p>",
