I believe the TBC version of Rawr took this into account. I've only tested the cat model for it, and it seems to keep on counting no matter how high you stack it. My understanding is feral hit cap is 296 with 214 expertise cap. Is this planned for a future update?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks again to everyone who works on this program, great job.<br>\r\n",
