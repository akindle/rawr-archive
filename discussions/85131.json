However I looked into the code a bit, and I'm wondering if you apply nature's grace in the correct way?</p>\r\n<p>In the source code, at Rawr.Moonkin, in SpellRotation.cs line 50&nbsp;says:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">mainNuke.NGCastTime = (<span style=\"color:blue\">float</span>)Math.Max(mainNuke.CastTime / (1 + spellHaste) / (1 + 0.2f * naturesGrace / 3.0f), instantCastNG);</p>\r\n<p>Question - does Nature's Grace really increase the cast speed after spellHaste has kicked in? Isn't it simply added to the spell haste? As in:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">mainNuke.NGCastTime = (<span style=\"color:blue\">float</span>)Math.Max(mainNuke.CastTime / (1 + spellHaste + 0.2f * naturesGrace / 3.0f), instantCastNG);&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Edit: Never mind, checked it in game, your formula is correct. Interesting implementaion by Blizzard I must say.</p>",
