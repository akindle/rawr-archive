So we're currently in an odd transition state where it doesn't quite work in some models. We're working on it, and will have them working soon. </span>&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>are there any models that have this working properly?&nbsp; or directions on what you did to get it working for a model?&nbsp; I'd like to see this fixed this for the elemental model ( if it's not already )&nbsp; and would like to see what changed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Basically I'm asking which Model is most ideal as a template or reference implementation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
