However, if you do use Rawr that way, be sure that you're updating the values you're giving Pawn every time you change gear/enchants/buffs/fightparameters, in order for them to stay accurate. It's really intended that you use Rawr to find upgrades *ahead of time*. The Optimizer &gt; Build Upgrade List feature is made especially for that, so you can just save a complete list of upgrades and including how much of an upgrade they are.<br>\r\n",
