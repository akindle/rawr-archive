    "Html": "<p>Ugh.&nbsp; First of all, you say you're doing 25-man raids.&nbsp; That means you should have at least one buff of every particular category.&nbsp; If you don't enable any buffs, Rawr assumes you're running without buffs and will show you as running OOM.&nbsp; Second, Rawr doesn't do stat weights because they change based on the gear, spec, and buffs that make each character unique.&nbsp; Rawr calculates a set of formulas - in the case of Moonkin, the formulas displayed in the WrathCalcs spreadsheet from Elitist Jerks - for your character, adding and removing pieces of gear to determine how much DPS each piece adds to you.</p>\r\n<p>I might add that much of this information could have been found by a basic search of either this site or either the Rawr thread or the Moonkin threads at Elitist Jerks.&nbsp; Please, everyone, spend your time doing your basic research so that we don't have to spend ours answering questions like these constantly.</p>",
