    "Html": "Hey, I just noticed that haste is rated extremely low for tree gear. I'm in SW gear, and value haste highly. Rawr is rating the haste healing cloak off of Illidan (Shroud of the Highbourne) lower than the cloaks from Karazhan and they're just not better. The shoulders off of Twins (Spaulders of Reclamation) are being rated lower than the T6 shoulders I assume also because of haste, but that rating is incorrect. Pre-Illidan gear, haste is pretty much non-existent and unneeded, but in Sunwell, it's very important and I expect it to continue to be so in WotLK. Rawr should reflect that in its stat ratings.<br>\r\n",
