If I have an chaotic skyfire diamond it reaquires 2 blue gems however the optimizer does not equip my gear with any blue, purple, or green gems even though I have them selected and it looks as though it grants me the bonus of the meta gem without having those gems equipped.&nbsp; Is this true?<br>\r\n",
