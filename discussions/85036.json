(which means I want to look at all gear out of heroic dungeons &amp; triumph, valor, conquest, heroism rewards)</p>\r\n<p>the problem I'm having is that when i update the item filter, none of the actual items change.&nbsp; I used a previous version of rawr to make sure it was the program malfunctioning, I used version 2.2.27 (the first version I had ever downloaded) Any thoughts? Soon this toon will have all the gear needed from these heroics, and from right now I can only guess what I need from the ICC 5-man heroic and normal dungeons.</p>",
