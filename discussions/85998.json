Reason for this would be to simply compare would it be large DPS loss to gear/gem unmissable and undodgeable, and I myself usually aim to reach the hit and expertise soft caps.

You just gear for dps and if you get more dps by having more misses, then so be it. Rarely an issue in the higher tiers of gear where hitrating and expertise are&nbsp;in abundant supply, but at naxx level gear it wasn't uncommon to get an actual upgrade by replacing an item with hitrating by an item without, getting more chances of misses, but still increasing DPS.<br><br>Is there a particular reason you really want to strive for 0% miss chance ?&nbsp; For the most part, this is already built into the DPS stat afterall, since hit and expertise are among the higher rated stats so long as you're below the soft cap. By enforcing 0% miss, you're likely going to be looking at a lower DPS value.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
