    "Html": "<p>With the rapid release of 2.3.1 today, I was hoping to see this little detail fixed. Alas, it was not to be. Many enchantments seem to be completely missing from Rawr. I haven't tried on my Tankadin character, yet. However, at least in Rawr.mage half of my current enchantments are missing. Specifically, it is the self use only enchants to rings, and Engineer tinkers to hands, feet, and back. So far, it appears limited to the self-use only types of Enchants.</p>\r\n<p>I would have assumed that you're aware of these, but the quick-fix release didn't fix it. I looked through discussions until I got back to 2.2.27 topics and didn't see anything.</p>",
