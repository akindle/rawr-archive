I can't give you an immediate schedule for exactly when the next build will be out the door, but I would like it to be Soon (tm).  Unfortunately, this means that it will probably ignore the latest new items, but my priority right now is to fight the immediate fires - unable to load characters, errors when optimizing, item sets, and other show-stopping bugs.  I would beg your patience as I get set into this role and try to wrangle things back on track; I am, after all, only a volunteer, and my time to work on Rawr is limited at best.<br />\n",
