I have all the cata enchants and gems clicked as available. I also optimized spell hit &lt;0 and chance to dodge &lt;0 as expected for enhance shaman.</p>\n<p>My gear is terrible atm but I just started again and wanted to get re-familiarized with rawr/enhism so I did an optimization. Long story short it keeps giving me Heartsong as my optimum enchant for both weapons, and occasionally will tell me to reforge a piece of gear to spirit. Am I doing something wrong that I dont know about? Im am expecting landslide X2 but keep getting the stupid Heartsong enchant. I double-checked on elitistjerks to make sure I wasnt missing anything drastic that changed and it verified Landslide X2.</p>\n<p>Any input is helpful. I am completely lost.</p>\n<p>Thanks Wartdog (Magtheridon-US)</p>",
