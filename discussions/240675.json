I then repeated the process just for the chest and it was 120dps upgrade.</p>\r\n<p>For giggles I wanted to check how much the bonus for 2 piece would give and then did an optimization with both and it gave me an upgrade of 160dps - or only 10dps extra from the 2 individual pieces. All the values and gear for optimizations were the same\r\n throughout. I would have thought 5% crit was worth more than 10dps, is this broken in some fashion currently?</p>\r\n",
