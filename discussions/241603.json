Not entirely sure how it is all meant to work as I'd never used that feature myself (no patience to let it run) and dislike\r\n running dual specs on my characters. If I ever need to switch role I switch character never switch spec. So I don't know exactly how different spec stuff works with the optimiser although I know it does especially for the classes where different spec means\r\n different way of doing stuff rather than different role (Healer, tank, ranged, melee).</p>\r\n",
