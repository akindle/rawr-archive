Since I need to maintain 164 spell hit rating (yes, the 126 cap bug has been fixed), it would be great to add that as an optimizer condition where I can say &quot;Optimize for max spell damage but maintain Spell Hit Rating &gt;= 164).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself struggling to maintain my 164 since so far all I have is Kara and pre-Kara gear and craftables, andmost of the new Sunwell &amp; badge loot stuff has spell haste but no spell hit rating. Anything that can help me deal with this would help a lot. Of course, this would help other classes too, like Moonkins, Retribution pallys and Warlocks to an extent.\r\n",

Just optimize for DPS, and let it choose the right amount of spell hit. (Unless you're trying to build a set for tanking Maulgar Mage or something, and don't want any spellsteal resists?)</div>",
