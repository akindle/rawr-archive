For some reason we keep having to deal with old information that does not include things like bindings and current drop information. I work on the filter and most of the information for searching items is based on this old information. Still filtering for things like &quot;Drops from onyxia in&quot; when armory and wowhead no longer report this so vague. Current reports for such items are &quot;Drops from Onyxia in Onyxia's Lair (10/25)&quot; and &quot;Drops from Onyxia in Heroic/Normal Onyxia's Lair&quot;. Having a up-to-date source files would make filtering easier, not to mention seriously cut down the amount of time a user has to spend refreshing all the information for there various toons. So if it is not to much to ask for, I vote for a updated Source Files to be in the next patch.</p>",
