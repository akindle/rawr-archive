Less to download, and you wouldn't necessarily have to increase the disk quota for the app.\r\n\r\nIt took me about about two days to build a quick proof of concept on my own machine.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was curious what the long term roadmap was for the project - do you plan to continue supporting WPF, WinForms, and Silverlight or just going Silverlight only?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "Html": "Yeah, I've considered splitting the app, but it's low priority at the moment. The Disk quota increase is required for the data files, which are shared between all models, and wouldn't be splittable. The app itself could be split by model, but since models are relatively small (zipped, 10-50k), it doesn't provide a huge benefit. I definitely want to do it at some point, it's just not high on our priority list right now.",
