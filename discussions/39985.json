Its my understanding that the mechanic that resilience works on has been removed inside of instances. I still see itemization for this stat inside all, if not most of the models (sry didn't check each one individually). Specifically it seems to be adding points to gear for bear form druids where it is not merited. While the itemization of the armor bonus not being removed on many of the pvp sets still makes it an attractive lure the lack of critablity through talent points should negate all but the DoT effects that resilience helped mitigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan this be verified and removed from the model?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks all those directly involved and contributors to this program. Its an incredibly valuable peice of work to the WoW community, and greatly appreciated.<br>\r\n",
