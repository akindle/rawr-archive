I think a green 2h \"of agility\" and ring \"of eluding\" are currently the best options for those slots.  Other greens come close to T6 and might be adequate substitutes for dodge-tank items.  <br /><br />I haven't heard of any druids who have actually done it, but it is possible to be 100% immune to physical damage through dodge + miss.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Rawr should be able to handle green &lt;of random enhancement&gt; items.  It's a lot of work for very little gain.  However, there are some valid reasons for wanting to compare a green item to end-game purples.<br />",
