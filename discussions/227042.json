The system cannot find the file specified.</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -OR-<br><strong>Access to the path 'C:\\Program Files\\Rawr v2.3.x\\Rawrlog.txt' is denied.</strong></p>\r\n<p>To give users a resource of what to do (so they can search for the error here) I'm making this post:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Installation Instructions:</strong> <a href=\"http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=Beginners+Guide+-+How+To+Unzip+and+Zip+Files&l=1\">http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=Beginners+Guide+-+How+To+Unzip+and+Zip+Files&amp;l=1</a><br>(As seen on the Downloads page, in the Documentation and at the top of the Discussions page.)</p>\r\n<p>There, that should solve the first one. Remember, you don't just unzip the EXE, you have to unzip the entire thing.</p>\r\n<p>The second is something we've mentioned in several threads in the past and should also be in the Documentation:</p>\r\n<p>Don't put <strong>Rawr</strong> in the <strong>Program Files</strong> directory. There are Windows Permissions issues with doing so. I highly recommend the <strong>Desktop</strong> because it's the easiest place to keep track of it.</p>",
