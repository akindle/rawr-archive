Given this item in particular no longer consumes a GCD when used and the hits are critable it now seems to offer higher DPS than the Hyperspeed Accelerators up to certain gearing lvls. My own basic testing leads me to believe that crit chance  is based on the users stats however atm I am am not sure if crit dmg modifiers from talents or other sources apply to the dmg. I suspect it does as I have observed hits in excess of 3030.</p>",
