I would however like to poke you guys about some buffs that I cannot seem to find that you might have forgotten to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one is the Blood Elf racial Arcane Torrent. I feel that this is a very nice addition after it got reworked since it restores 6% of your mana every 2 minutes (or Runes / Energy).<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=28730\">http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=28730</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond one is that I've noticed the Tailoring-only enchants are missing from cloaks, while the profession-bound boosts as enchant on rings, BoP gems, BoP shoulder enchants and BoP spellpower on bracers from leatherworking are in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one gives 300 mana restore on spellcast proc - <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55769\">http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55769</a><br>\r\nSecond one causes an additional 1000-1200 holy damage proc upon spellcast - <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55642\">http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55642</a><br>\r\nThird one increases AP by 300 for 15 seconds, proc on melee damage - <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55777\">http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55777</a><br>\r\n",
