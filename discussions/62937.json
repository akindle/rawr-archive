Armory import of reputations, allowing Rawr to mark rep-based items and enchants as available by default (user option).</p>\r\n<p>2. Currently, running the Optimizer is an all-or-nothing process. You let it finish completely, or you cancel it.</p>\r\n<p>2a. An option to Pause would be nice. This computer I'm on is having a bit of a time handing Rawr's chewing along with my desire to fill that time reading comic strips online. It would be nice to be able to pause Rawr for a moment, load up something, then resume Rawr.</p>\r\n<p>2b. A suspend option would be even nicer. Sometimes it takes a couple of hours to complete an upgrade list; if I run out of time to use the computer before it's done, I have to cancel and lose it all. It'd be awesome to save a partially-done optimize or upgrade list, move computers and resume (I use Rawr on a flash drive).</p>\r\n<p>Thank you all so much for your work!</p>",
