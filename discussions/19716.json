As some bosses and trash/Ads requier resistance and crit immunity it would be a great feture to be able to see the resistance on my current gear and also shoose res enchants like <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Flame%20Armor%20Kit\">Flame Armor Kit</a> to a gear, this to be able to see if I reach the destinated resistance and/or the crit immunity cap with that gear or if I have to change something else.<br />At the moment I have to do all the resistance calcs on paper while having the res gear in Rawr for the Miti/Surv info.<br />Is this a possible fearure to add?<br /><br />Best reguards<br />Barlybear<br />",

A siggestion to you is, grab the 2 instance dropped resil trinkets, earthwarden and a single S3/vind piece of gear and that's all you need to be crit immune to 73s.<br /><br />That leaves 11 slots of gear free to equip resist on ^_^<br />",
