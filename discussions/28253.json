I worked it out myself (it is 1/4, so 1000dps = 250mp5), but I went for ages on the assumption that it was 1/10th (since I knew high end shadowpriests topped out at about 1800dps, and most of Rawr's options default to something appropriate for end-game raiders). I wouldn't be surprised if other mages are ignorant of how shadowpriest mechanics work.<br>\r\n",
