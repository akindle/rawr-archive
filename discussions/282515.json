I simply just want to edit items/entchants and then saving the profile without RAWR updating the dps and stopping my pc from working for 5sec.</p>\r\n<p>So how can I stop RAWR from updating the DPS every time I change something? It's pretty annoying :/</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you</p>\r\n",
