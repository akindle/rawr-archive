I checked the volcanic potion box under buffs ( not the double potion\r\n thingy ) with the volcanic potion box under options / spells and buffs ( why are there two boxes for it anyways ?? )</p>\r\n",

If you really want to you can try to use the advanced solver, but I wouldn't advise it unless you're very interested in theorycrafting optimal cooldown stacking.</p>\r\n<p>For your mastery problem I haven't seen anything like that. You'll have to post an issue with your character xml.</p>",
