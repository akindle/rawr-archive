I've went through and added alot of sub filters ( all new ICC instances are separate from other instances, 10 man raids are group together, 25 also together).  Also, each new release seems to change filters around, like I couldn't find a voa in .17.  Are filters in a single file?  I'd love to move my filters around to different versions, but no huge deal.",
