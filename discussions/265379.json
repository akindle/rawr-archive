I have occasionally run into a situation where I have started a long (ctrl-click) optimization, and don't have time to let it finish, but already it is significantly\r\n higher than my best existing gear set. Such a feature would at least let me 1) use the better set until I have time for a full run and 2) see if there's any obvious difference I can make use of in preparing shorter optimizations.</p>\r\n<p>The ability to pause and see the best so far would also be useful, so that you can make sure it's not doing something obviously wrong (because you forgot to add/remove a piece, say) without losing your place.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for an awesome tool!</p>\r\n<p>-puk</p>\r\n",
