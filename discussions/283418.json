Rimes GCDs Value\r\nOB     -2   30   .72   -1    53\r\nFS    .45  -32     0   -1    52 \r\nHBr     0   10     1   -1    32\r\nHB     -1   20     0   -1    32\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>And, again for example, the solver might be given 27.5 runes, 36.4 rp and 64 gcds to start with. &nbsp;There must be some generalized kind of algorithm that can come up with an optimal solution, right?</p>\r\n",
