    "Html": "It seems that on live Frostfire gets an extra 3% (or possibly more) from Elemental Precision. I wanted to add this hit rating into Rawr, but I was not sure how to go about doing so. I attempted to modify the xml to add my own buff, but whenever I reloaded Rawr the xml file was reverted. I understand that adding a flat 80 hit rating effects Living Bomb and Pyroblast incorrectly, but is there an easier way to add a flat 80 hit rating? I'm not positive, but I would think that +80 hit to Frostfire Bolt would require some modification of the source, no?",

We can disprove that EP gives 3%, but we can't either prove or disprove the 6% hypothesis. We would need a larger sample or a sample with 11% hit gear to get higher confidence.

    "Html": "i had the exact same question as pigmonkey. gear with hit on it gets rated high, though im already 40 over 'frostfire cap'. since over half my damage done is from frostfire bolt, this effectively halves the value for hit (right?). this would result in gear with hit rating getting a 'penalty'(for overcapping) instead of a 'bonus' they get now because hit is just an important stat. wheter or not its smart to not cap the other fire spells can be discussed somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwithout hit being listed as top stat (or very close to spellpower) spellpower would be the only good remaining stat with (for me) ~1,5 times the value of crit and haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni did some tests on the dummy as well, its late so i stopped at 500 casts. managed to get the exact right 289 hit rating (288 is too low) with some older gear :). anyway not a single full resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nscreenshot:<br>\r\nhttp://img361.imageshack.us/img361/5694/frostfirehitip9.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nalso logged wws:<br>\r\nhttp://wowwebstats.com/wek4vutsuifu0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthere's a thread about it on EJ as well. its not just some rumors anymore, it really seems like 6% (or more) is the new number.<br>\r\nhttp://elitistjerks.com/f75/t37364-frostfire_bolt_thread/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni was wondering if there is any way in rawr to set it to 6% or do we have to wait for the next release? i think its pretty important, everyone is using the program now for loads of new gear etc. you know yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nanyway i hope you can use the test i did. good luck with implementing it :) <br>\r\n",
