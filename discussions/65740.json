I would like export the gearset into an spreadsheet, for example an openoffice one, so I can print the full equipment i'm going to farm as a checklist or something similar. By now RAWR only Exports the Char-Stats into the clipboard.</p>\r\n<p>I don't know wheter other users would like something similar as well, but it would be a cool feature to me.</p>\r\n<p>Neither this thread http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=54547, nor this one http://rawr.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=45869 solve what I'm looking for. ;)</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely</p>",
