One thing I would initially try is remove all the files except Rawr.exe, Rawr.exe.config, Rawr.Base.dll and Rawr.Bear.dll. Try what happens with that minimum setup. If even that won't load properly then next steps kind of depend on how much time you have to help us find the cause for it. If you feel like it you can try installing the free Visual C# Express and compile the source code yourself and see if that makes any difference.\r\n",

This is a fairly new computer (~3 months old), and Rawr had worked fine up until last week, when I downloaded the new version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Compiling myself seems to have worked; however, I have no idea what I'm doing. After opening the source code in the C# editor, I clicked on &quot;Start Debugging&quot; and Rawr opened and was working fine. However, I have no idea how to finalize it or whatever (I'm in way over my head here) so that I can use it without going through C# each time. Can anyone help?<br>\r\n",

You should see a new folder called bin and inside a folder called Debug. There you should find the Rawr.exe that you can start directly. Another thing to do is from c# on top in the toolbar you will see a dropdown that says Debug. Change that to Release and compile again. That should create a new folder inside bin called Release and is a more optimized version. See if there is any difference between the two. \r\n",
