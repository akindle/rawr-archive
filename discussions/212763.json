This is just the bare minimum at this point (I'm not even going to attempt how to implement each mastery tier at this point). I currently have two questions. One is should I hard code the mastery-per-talent into each module or should I put is somewhere else (such as statconversion.cs. Secondly is what fuction in RAWR tells how many points are associated with each tree? If there isn't one availabe, which file would be the most likely place to have one?</p>",
