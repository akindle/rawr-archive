Once we are confident that they have been updated in the various models can we have a new release this weekend please as lots of people are asking what the changes mean for their gearing.</p>\r\n<p>It may be an idea to catalog the things that need checking. eg:</p>\r\n<p><br>Deathbringer's Will proc is it updated for all models?</p>\r\n<p>Tiny Abomination in a Jar - has the special effect been implemented? Does this need special handling in models?</p>\r\n<p><a rel=\"http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50709/bryntroll-the-bone-arbiter//tooltip/js\" href=\"http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50709/bryntroll-the-bone-arbiter/\"><strong><span style=\"color:#a335ee\">Bryntroll, the Bone Arbiter</span></strong></a> - has the fix for Ret pallys and Unholy DKs been implemented in those models &quot;We have found a bug with Bryntroll where it procs too often for Retribution paladins or Unholy DKs. For example both portions of Scourge Strike could cause a proc, which is unintended. Bryntroll seems to account for about ~3-4% of dps for a typical Icecrown Fury warrior. That's more of where it should be for other melee.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Black Bruise - I've updated this weapons proc rate for next version as per testing.</p>\r\n<p>Are we implementing the rogue changes - or are we still leaving the rogue model alone as we have no rogue developer? &quot;</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\">\r\n<li>The base damage bonus from Hunger for Blood has been reduced from 10% to 5%.</li>\r\n<li>The bonus damage rogues gain from attack power for poisons has been decreased. This applies to Instant Poison, Deadly Poison, and Wound Poison.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are probably others that should go in the quick checklist that I'm not aware of - ie: things that should be &quot;hotfixed&quot; before we release the v2.3.6.</p>",
