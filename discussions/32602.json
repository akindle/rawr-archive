Will save me countless hours, excellent work guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing I noticed, and it may well be that I need to RTFM a little better (though I have tried) - when I have a trinket that temporarily boosts +spell dmg, when I check the suggested spell cycles I notice it suggests to &quot;use&quot; the trinket far more often than it is available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate by example, if you load my character (Darchangel, Jubei'Thos) into Rawr in Mage-model, and check the Spell Cycle, you'll see that it suggests to pop the Trinket far more frequently than the cooldown will allow. No idea if this is an issue or my stupidity - please let me know :) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers,<br>\r\nDarchangel\r\n",
