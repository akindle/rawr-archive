Instead, the first melee attack taken generates Vengeance equal to one third of the damage dealt by that attack. As Vengeance\r\n updates during the fight, it is always set to at least a third of the damage taken in the last two seconds. It still climbs from that point at the previous rate, still decays at the previous rate, and still cannot exceed the current maximum.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[/quote]</p>\r\n",
