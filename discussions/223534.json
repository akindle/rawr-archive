However, I can't get to the menu to specify an enchant(s) and then have a red dot like I used to.&nbsp;I was under the impression that a blue gem simply meant that the gemming was locked in, not the enchanting. Is it now that a blue gem means &quot;this item is only available as-is for both gemming and enchant&quot;?&nbsp;Also: I'm assuming the &quot;Add custom gemming...&quot; functionality isn't finished yet, because it isn't showing me any gems or enchants to select (and yes, I made sure they were enabled).</p>\r\n<p>Sorry again if I'm just being extremely obtuse.&nbsp;</p>",
