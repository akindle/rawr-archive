Instead of marking items with green diamonds we mark just the specific gemmings we have with a blue diamond and restricting enchants on that item to just the enchant that your item currently has. If you have more of the same item you can specify this by marking several enchants as available or marking several gemmings with blue diamond.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following this, I only marked one specific gemming/enchanting set with the blue diamond, and unmarked other options for that particular piece, but the Optimizer still includes the unmarked versions in its recommended sets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Again, any help is welcome, even if it includes cute little links like lmgtfy.com or whatever else you want.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll kick myself in the head once I see what in TFM I'm missing, misreading, or misunderstanding.</p>",

For example - I have a Sash of Ancient Power that has 3 gems - 1 Purified Dreadstone -&nbsp;1 Runed Stormjewel - and 1 Runed Cardinal Ruby. The optimizer wants to change the Runed Stormjewel to a Runed Cardinal Ruby even though they have the same stats.
