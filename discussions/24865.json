We should be able to allow for filtering or auto selecting items for the optimizer using this information.  There are a few items that I just cant seem to get any information about from the armory (e.g. http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/item-info.xml?i=34353 - notice the armory doesn't even tell you where it comes from).  If there are any items that are missing location information, post an item number (or link) here and I will see if I can figure out why.<br />",
