I have a question prolly not so much about Rawr, more likely about an addon that I m looking for.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I d need some addon that shows me how much % of the combat I spend in FSR and how much % of the time replenishment is up, how many and what spells did I cast during the encounters... all these kind of stuff that will help me correctly set up my gear.\r\n If you guys know about addon or addons that fulfill these requirements of mine, I d rly appreciate any tips. Thanks a lot.</p>\r\n",
