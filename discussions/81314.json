I'm currently using 2 pieces of tier 10 (gloves/chest) along with 2 pieces of tier 9. &nbsp;Here is my current gear:</p>\r\n<p>Head<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Runetotem's Headguard of Triumph (i245)<br>Neck<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Charge of the Eredar (i258)<br>Shoulders<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Runetotem's Shoulderpads of Triumph (i245)<br>Chest<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Sanctified Lasherweave Raiment<br>Waist<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Belt of the Pitiless Killer (i245)... grrr, 258 needs to drop already!<br>Legs<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Legwraps of the Broken Beast (i258)<br>Feet<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Icewalker Treads (i258)<br>Wrist<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Toskk's Maximized Wristguards<br>Hands<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Sanctified Lasherweave Handgrips<br>Finger1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Ashen Band of Endless Vengeance<br>Finger2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Saurfang's Cold-Forged Band<br>Trinket1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Death's Choice (i245)<br>Trinket2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Deathbringer's Will<br>Back<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Cloak of the Untamed Predator (i258)<br>MainHand<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Distant Land<br>Ranged<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Idol of Mutilation</p>\r\n<p>Which nets me...<br>Hit Rating:<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>280<br>Expertise Rating:<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>74 (+10 expertise from talents)<br>Armor Penetration Rating:<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>827</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Upon exploring my options for getting the next two pieces of tier 10 it looks like shoulders and helm would be the biggest DPS boost with my current gear. &nbsp;However, this leaves me with -0- expertise from gear. &nbsp;Granted, I'll still have the 10 from talents, but I'm still shy of the cap by 132 rating. &nbsp;It seems odd to me that rawr is telling me that expertise gems over agility and ArP would be a DPS loss with such low expertise rating.</p>\r\n<p>I know hit and expertise for cats isn't as important as other classes/specs, but this just seems a little extreme.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>Matt</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Yeah, expertise isn't a bad stat, by any stretch. Agi and ArPen are just better. So you'll never want to gem for it, and it's quite possible that gear choices available to you limit how much you have. It does mean, however, that you have to watch for misses in your attacks. If you'd rather that your attacks are completely&nbsp;predictable, you can optimize with an additional requirement of Chance to be Avoided &lt;= 0. Or, do what Gwin does, and do &lt;= 0.1%. If you're in a position where you can't devote all your attention to DPSing (such as if you're raid leading or something), that may be a DPS gain for you.</p>",
