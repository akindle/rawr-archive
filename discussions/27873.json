where the options tab would just be a two-column table, corresponding to this spreadsheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would also provide a tool for people leveling.  A level 40 feral leveling druid might decide (rightly or wrongly) to use weights of<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStr = 1<br>\r\nAgi = .85<br>\r\nStam = .75<br>\r\nInt = Spi = .4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand have a useful tool for finding upgrades (although this really needs better support for importing &quot;of the Eagle&quot; type items).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my spreadsheet, I actually don't enter these raw values.  Instead I have fairly simple models that produced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Burst DPS (1 +spell = .0532% improvement, spell crit = .0201%)<br>\r\n2) Sustained DPS (+spell = .0648%, crit = .0289%)<br>\r\n3) Moonkin Survivability (stam = .0706%, resil = .0304%, Armor (gear) = .0079%)<br>\r\n4) Burst healing (heal = .0259%, crit =.0205%)<br>\r\n5) Sustained healing (heal = .0518%, crit = .0029%)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere &quot;Sustained&quot; means that mana conservation/regeneration is a significant concern.  I then decided that for battlegrounds I'd use a weighting of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n35% Burst DPS<br>\r\n5% Sustained DPS<br>\r\n40% Survival<br>\r\n15% Burst healing<br>\r\n5% Sustained healing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then normalized the results so that +spell/heal had a value of 1.00.  For other activities (say healing a 5-man PuG instance,), I might use the same base tables, but with substantially different weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in addition to the ability to create AEP-style tables, it would be nice to be able use weighted-combinations of such tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts?\r\n",

    "Html": "Actually, weights are perfectly valid, but change frequently, and they are used in Rawr. For example, if you look at the Prot Warrior, you have weighting between Threat, Mitigation, and Survival. In the Mage model, you can lookup the DPS value of 10 more points in damage, hit rating, etc (near the bottom of the list of charts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is wrong is thinking that weights don't change. Weights are different from fight to fight, and the value of stats also varies with every piece of gear you change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it can be valuable to get the weignting of stats with your current gear, for use in roughly estimating the value of a new piece of gear in game. There are many mods that will 'rate' gear using a set of values you give it. When having to decide quickly in a raid whether to spend points on an item or not, having a single value assigned to gear, even if it's just a rough estimate, is very convenient. After I replace a couple pieces of gear I go back to Rawr.Mage and figure out the new stat values based on my current gear... typically they change only a little bit. Spell crit is slowly climbing up to be just as good as +spell damage and haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint is that some models already provide weightings between different factors, and other models already provide ratings for stats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the request above is too ambitious. You can't model healing and DPS in the same model with any kind of sanity, nor is Rawr designed to model lowbies. It's a raiding tool (or at least instancing tool) for level 70 characters filling a specific role in PvE. It's not designed to model PvP, lowbies, or multi-role armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>\r\n",
