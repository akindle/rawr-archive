Initially I thought rawr might be assuming that redoubt is always up but even when I removed all my talents it said I was still un-hittable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then I have played around with tankadin starting with no gear or talents. As I start adding equipment, the values seem fine. However, as I add more items there will be a point where the block chance will suddenly jump to being maxed. Sometimes this can happen after only two items are added (just boots and legs when I did it) and I don't even have a shield equiped.<br>\r\n",
