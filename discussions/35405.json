Most guides I read suggests spirit has a preference over mp5, yet when I look at the scores for gems and enchants it seems like your model prefers mp5. Actually all gems with mp5 are ranked very high, even if they don't have other useful stats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I completely wrong saying that spirit is better for a Tree Druid?<br>\r\n",
