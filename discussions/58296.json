Afaik they are both supposed to give +20% haste, but the tooltip under the buff pane says Imp WF is 16+3.45= 19.45% haste. (Just a tooltip error?)</p>\r\n<p>In the comparisons part, if I list all buffs currently in play on my char, Imp Icy talons graphically displays to contribute a lot more to my dps than Imp WF does (20% more) Why is that?</p>\r\n<p>However, under the Stats pane it displays my dps as the same with Imp WF and Imp Icy talons. (So I guess my total dps is displayed correctly whether I chose Imp WF or Imp Icy Talons)</p>",

So of the buff charts, they appear different, because you're seeing the full Imp Icy Talons (20%) compared to the plain Windury (16%), and then there's another Imp Windfury (4%) way down the list. Imp Windfury is listed as 3.45%, not 4%, as TNSe explained, because we handle all haste effects multiplicatively, and since it got broken into 2 buffs, that need to be additive with each other, we adjusted it down to 3.45%, which totals to 20% when multiplied.</p>",
