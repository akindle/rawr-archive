    "Html": "For my optimally geared character, the current version of Rawr uses Shred for combo points as soon as I either remove 2T6, or remove Imp Mangle. Only if both of those are present does it use Mangle. Even in that situation, Idol of Worship provides more DPS than Idol of the Ravenous Beast, so still going with that, though. Having JUST Imp Mangle and not 2T6 is right on the border between Mangle or Shred being better, and it can go either way depending on gear. Keep trying things, I'd be surprised if you really can't make it use Shred.<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Thanks for the response.   Without they mangle glyph and with only 1pc of T6 equipped it switches from shred to mangle when I add a 2nd point in Imp. Mangle.   0/3, 1/3 = shred, 2/3 &amp; 3/3 = mangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 2pcT6, I don't need any points in Imp.Mangle for it to say mangle for combo points.   So with either 2pcT6 or Imp.Mangle it seems mangling is the way to go - and it certainly simpilifes the rotation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
