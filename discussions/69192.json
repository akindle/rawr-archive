You can now tell what the frack slot it's talking about with the items where the name is a little ambiguous to it's slot.</p>\r\n<p>And since a lot of people need their hand's held with this kind of stuff, here's <strong>how to enable it</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>1. Start/Run Rawr<br>2. Go to the toolbar up top and click 'Tools'<br>3. Select the menu item 'Options...'<br>4. Click the 'General Settings' item in the Left-hand column<br>5. Check 'Display Item Types in Tooltips'<br>6. Activate any other settings changes that are on this panel you wish to activate (since a lot of you are probably seeing this for the first time).<br>7. Click the OK button at the bottom<br>8. Tada! Be sure to exit the program and restart it to ensure that the setting is properly saved.</p>",
