    "Html": "<p>Hi Astrylian-- long time, no see :) I haven't been dwelling in the Rawr world much (mostly because I don't have to worry about bear tanking). &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have a couple of comments about various things discussed in this thread:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) This is the first time I've seen any mention in kitty DPS theorycrafting where it recommended switching to mangle for CP generation. &nbsp;I'm not saying it's wrong-- it's just something that's taken on trust unless you go code-diving. &nbsp;The bigger deal is, if there are discoveries in the theorycraft that are introduced in the model, but don't make it out to the player base, then you're just creating a &quot;perfect&quot; calculator which only people who read this discussion section or read the code every release will know what's going on (and sometimes, not even then). &nbsp;It is the biggest weakness of Rawr-- I barely use it because half the time I don't know why it's reporting something is drastically changed. &nbsp;If the optimal point where I should mangle instead of shred exists, and it depends on my gear, then the calculator absolutely needs to tell me that I need to change how I play. &nbsp;It needs to tell me &quot;Now it's optimal to bite at 8.6 seconds left on Rip, but only if Tiger's Fury will be available before Rip expires&quot; if it's using that in the calculation. &nbsp;Otherwise, the estimations on mangle replacing shred isn't really useful. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>2) I'm also uncertain as to whether the calculator, in saying to do what those cycles require, needs knowledge it can't possibly have-- for instance, at the end of a cycle you know you needed more energy to not have downtime on Rip while getting in an FB, but that's because of a streak of non-crits. &nbsp;Are you using that depth of probability math in mangle/shred replacements? &nbsp;Is the advice necessary to follow these cycles more complex than to effectively use? (I.e. if you crit on your first shred, keep shredding; if you don't, then mangle. &nbsp;If you have 2 CP now, mangle; if you got an OoC proc...)</p>\r\n<p>3) If you're incorporating different attack models/sequences, you REALLY need to spell this out in the application a little more. &nbsp;Right now, the only indication of what is going on is a single tooltip on the player page, and it's not obvious when this changes with every gear replacement. &nbsp;Essentially, the more information about cycle development, the better-- it may be a better delivery system for theorycraft knowledge (given that people don't read forums as much as they'd use Rawr) as well. &nbsp;You might go so far as to have a way to compare different models-- say two models are very close, but one is easier to execute. &nbsp;I'll probably want to use the one that's easier to execute, so long as two are close. &nbsp;Perhaps you might also asterisk an item selection if it forces you into a new model.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) So, the point is that RSVs shouldn't be used to make gear decisions. The problem is, a lot of in-game quick evaluations are RSV-based. The following circumstances are generally true:<br>- I don't have Rawr open when I raid, because I don't want anything interrupting my main system's performance. &nbsp;Or, I just didn't have it open pre-raid.&nbsp;<br>- I don't have the mental capacity to know the magnitude of all possible upgrades, especially when there are multiple upgrades in every slot.<br>- I certainly don't have the mental capacity to know the magnitude of all possible upgrades after I've taken a first, random upgrade.&nbsp;<br>- I can get more than one upgrade a night, so any &quot;exact&quot; item calculations I've done are, simply wrong.&nbsp;<br>So right now, the options available to me to follow your advice and not use RSVs are:&nbsp;<br>- Research every possible first upgrade in Rawr; then, research every possible second upgrade in Rawr. &nbsp;Write these down or move them to a third-party app and print them out.<br>- Ask my loot master to wait while I alt-tab, fire up Rawr and evaluate the upgrade. (I look like an unprepared raider.)&nbsp;<br>- Evaluate the possible upgrades pre-pull every time.&nbsp;<br><br>Obviously all this gets easier as we approach best-in-slot gear (fewer potential upgrades, greater knowledge of loot tables, etc) but as far as practicality goes, it's not &quot;worth it&quot; to most players to do this every time. &nbsp;Instead, they can set up a Pawn add-on very simply with RSVs, and the entire process is &quot;hover over the item and look at its pawn value, versus your current item.&quot; &nbsp;<br><br>Given the time and effort put into Rawr, perhaps it's time to make an in-game addon simplifying all of this. &nbsp;All it would need to do is store an array of item IDs and Rawr-exported item values, associated to a pre-existing gear set. &nbsp;It would drop the values into a tooltip, just like Pawn does. &nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hey Allev. Indeed, long time no see. Might be seeing more of me in the not too distant future, BTW. :)</p>\r\n<p>1/2) Trading Shreds for Mangles went away when I fixed the bug where it was allowing more than 5cp per Bite, when paired with Rip. Nevermind. :)</p>\r\n<p>3) That basically comes down needing a better Stats tab, which is coming. The Bear side of things also has a chart of the TPS and DPS of each cycle. I could implement that for Cat as well.</p>\r\n<p>4) Actually, that's one thing Rawr really does handle well. Build an upgrade list, and export it to an image. You can either leave that image open when you raid, open it quick when something drops, or just print it out. Using Pawn to decide on whether to bid on something, when it drops, is a terrible thing to do, and one I really want to discourage users from doing.</p>",
