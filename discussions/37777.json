I could see the files listed but when I tried to extract it maxed out CPU and basically hung the PC until I killed the process. After a bit of tinkering I tried 7zip and it unzipped just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I'm just saying can you put something on the download page because it's probably going to cause grief for other people too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a better note, looking forward to tinkering with spec and gear now the new Rawr is out. Thanks for the dedication in releasing a new version so quick.<br>\r\n",
