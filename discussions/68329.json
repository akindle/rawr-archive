I am using out-of-the-box rawr settings (buffs and options)&nbsp;for the Healadin.</p>\r\n<p>If it makes any difference for this question, my build is this:<br><a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#sxAzgM0sVu0xgdxZVcbx:dfwcz\">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#sxAzgM0sVu0xgdxZVcbx:dfwcz</a></p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",

    "Html": "<p>You're probably right at a 2 or 4-piece T8.&nbsp; The reason the T8 is valued so high is because the set bonus is rolled into the gear value.&nbsp; So it's not just the stats on the shoulders themselves, but also taking into account the fact that you would be breaking a set bonus to pick up the new piece.</p>",
