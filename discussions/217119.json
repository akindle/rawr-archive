You'll take less damage & leave the healers to do more important things, and you'll run into range of an add soon to start dps sooner = do more damage.

    "Html": "I find the difference between Icewalker and Tuskanarr to be a personal preference. If your hurting for hit (especially in lower tier gear), then I find Icewalker to be better. However in higher-end gear (such as 245 ToC or ICC gear) running out of fires faster is a lot more useful than hit (plus there is generally a large amount of hit available in the gear). At that stage, I find Tuskanarr better. As for BrW's comment, Cat's Swiftness is the best running speed enchant for non-Kitty melee outside Engineering (I &lt;3 my kitties 30% run speed). I love it that my mage knows that enchant since quite a few guildies request it.",
