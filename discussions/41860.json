As per a few posts on EJ forums, with 5/5 GoTE and Wrath of Air Totem, we only need 325 haste to hit the 1 second GCD cap. Considering I cast far far more instnat heals than I do long cast times, I'm not as worried about having ridiculously low cast time on regrowth as I am say about it and other spells critting more often.Â  I think at least giving us the Wrath of Air Totem as a buff option will help somewhat with the modeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDev~ \r\n",
