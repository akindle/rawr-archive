What i found was kinda weird that in 2.2.14 it socketed all STR and then 2.2.15 it socketed all ArP, kinda hard to believe everyone saying we will start socketing STR after the nerf and Rawr is telling me to actually go to it. Also another bad vibe I'm getting is the dps reading in 2.2.14 is 5.4k and on 2.2.15 its 3.7. Is the ArP really gonna hurt are dps that much? Has anyone else played with the numbers between the 2 versions?</p>",
