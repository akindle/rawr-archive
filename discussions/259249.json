    "Html": "<p>The scenario is simple and common: You have optimized for your spec but then you want to see if you can make a \"partial specialized set of gear\" for another spec. i.e. You need to keep all the items of the main spec intact and then draw from a pool of available  items, that may be replacing the main spec items, to specialize for another spec. The main spec's items can remain partially the same, or be replaced with the bank items. But if they remain, they can not be reforged/regemmed/reenchanted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IF it's not possible, I believe it's a very good feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>edit: PS.
