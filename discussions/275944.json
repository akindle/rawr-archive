The only option I found under &quot;Additional Requirements&quot; was &quot;Avoided attacks %&quot;, so I played with this. At first I set this to 0. Result: hit cap &#43; exp hard cap. So I started\r\n increasing the &quot;Avoided attacks %&quot;. Result: hit was reduced and expertise was kept high. Nomatter what % I chose, hit was the first to suffer from it. Any ideas how I should be setting which parameters and where?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the help,</p>\r\n",
