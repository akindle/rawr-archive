    "Html": "As I recall, capping for cats just doesn't do that much for us [compared to other classes].\r\n\r\nMost DPS classes [Paladin, Warlock, Hunter, Rogue from personal experience] have an ability that is on cooldowns that makes a huge difference in DPS if it misses; for example, Ret judging [misses mean no mana], Warlock Haunt or Conflagarate, Hunter Black Arrow, Rogues I can't recall off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nCats don't [unless one has been added?  I haven't done much cat since 3.3] - which means that if they miss or are dodged, they just recast their spell immediately.\r\n\r\nAs for consistent cycle, I never really saw any sort of consistency in cat DPS - between the variances in special ability cooldowns and OOC procs, cat DPS was always the most confusing [which is why I ran with FBN suggestions, but not for example Faceroll:Affliction].",

    "Html": "Correct. Cats missing a yellow attack just cost a meager part of the attack's energy cost (I think it's 20%), potentially a GCD of debuff uptime, and a GCD. We're not GCD locked, so miss just affects white damage mostly.\r\n\r\nThe most significant cost of missing is probably that you have to pay more attention to your rotation, and actually recast the same ability next. It adds a very significant chance for you to 'screw up' your rotation.",
