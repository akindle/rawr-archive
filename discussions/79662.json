It then appeared in the list of items in the edit item dialog. It appeared as if it would appear everywhere else, but no matter what item I add it never appears ANYWHERE except the edit items dialog. If I click an item to try and equip it and start typing the name it doesnt appear or if I use the right column and sort alphabetically it doesn't appear. How the heck do I use items I've added?</p>",
