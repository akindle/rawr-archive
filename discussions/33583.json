The relevant stat changes are: +11 crit rating, +16 expertise rating, and +17 haste rating for the Lightbringer. Strength is equivalent with equal gemmings. The only thing that should change Judgement of Blood's damage is +dmg, as it doesn't scale with anything else. Crusader Strike doesn't scale with haste like white damage does, but it SHOULD benefit from the expertise (I have none without the bracers) and the crit rating. Let me know if you need any more info from me, and definitely let me know if I'm missing something.<br>\r\n",
