For example it is preferred to put<br>braces on new lines for if statements and always included them for each<br>case:<br><br>(bad style - work)<br>if ( a = 4 ) {<br>\t... do something<br>}<br>else<br>\t.. do another thing<br><br><br>(good style - work)<br>if ( a = 4 )<br>{<br>\t... do something<br>}<br>else<br>{<br>\t... do another thing<br>}<br><br>Second example is to not put more than one class in a file. The reason<br>behind this was that it is much easier to locate where a class is<br>defined by searching for a file with the same name.<br><br>Final example is to use predefined constants instead of magic numbers<br>(e.g. using public static int MaxValue = 5 instead of using the number 5<br>all over in the code).<br><br>These are the kinds of things I was wondering about.",
