Your work on this project has gone a long way to helping my toons. I have on many occations when people ask me &quot;Which is better&quot; or &quot;How do I gem&quot;. I\r\n have refereed them to Rawr to teach them to &quot;fish&quot; rather then feeding them for the day.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Right now I have a little morning ritual of checking the Source Code looking for ProtPally updates then over to wow site to see hot fix notes then finally log into wow and do dailies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So have a good day, drink lots of coffee, and know that for everyone that makes a &quot;Thank You&quot; post their are 100's of others too shy to post.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cya in game!</p>\r\n",
