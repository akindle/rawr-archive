Perhaps we should pick that discussion up again?<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/15785\">http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/15785</a> - This was a multi-model, multi-issue ticket, which we probably should have asked the guy to divide up. :)  The remaining issue for ProtPaladin is implementing a survival soft cap.  I, um, kind of overlooked that part of it, so I'll see about implementing one similar to Bear's this weekend.  I do not intend to implement the healing portion of Ardent Defender, which was also mentioned in this ticket, because it's only available for a Paladin if it's off of cooldown.  There are also other parts of that ticket for other models that I do not know the status of.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/16472\">http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/16472</a> - Closed. \\o/  The remaining issue on this ticket is one of absorption.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/17614\">http://rawr.codeplex.com/workitem/17614</a> - This was implemented incorrectly in ProtPaladin, and thus I have not turned it on.  The current discussion centers around splitting the current DamageAbsorbed stat, although Astrylian's come in to state Essence of Gossamer's proc should not be modeled.  With that being the case, my proposed solution is to not model Essence of Gossamer's proc at all (take out the proc that's there), and use DamageAbsorbed only for Corroded Skeleton Key.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTL;DR:<br><br>\r\n\r\n1) ProtPaladin will implement a survival soft cap.<br>\r\n2) We need to come to a conclusion on the HP5 discussion, whether we will implement it or not, and how.<br>\r\n3) If my solution for DamageAbsorbed is good, I will implement that.\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Roncli, I briefly looked at your commit into ProtWarr for DamageAbsorbed, but wasn't fully sure what the intent was.</p>\r\n<p>It seems that DamageAbsorbed really needs to be tracked, triggered, and accumulated in a 'DamageAbsorbedPerSecond' way, then subtracted from the overall damage you take. Otherwise, I don't really see a way to properly average it into an over-time scenario.</p>\r\n<p>There are also edge cases to consider such as the duration of the absorb effect being too short to actually consume the entire absorb--while this is not the case in typical scenarios, in certain gearsets or scenarios (e.g. Anub-25 add Warrior tanking setups) it could dramatically skew the result.</p>\r\n<p>There were previous discussions on HP5, but frankly I'm not sure there is too much reason to implement it unless there is a significant movement to including all self-healing effects somehow. This opens a large can of worms, and I'm not sure it's worth it just for one item. I doubt we'll be seeing any more HP5 items in the future. (However, self-healing is going to potentially be an issue in Cata, with talents such as Blood Craze likely becoming viable staples for Prot Warriors.)</p>\r\n<p>Next week is a reprieve from crunch overtime for me, so I can probably do a pass of the ProtWarr issues, but quickly looking over them most of them are very old suggestions or issues which are either no longer relevant or decided/stated not to integrate as features (e.g. Last Stand/Shield Wall being averaged into total survival.)</p>",

The damage component may be easier to factor, but still need to take into consideration either an approximate or the player's actual parry chance to figure out the chance of getting a proc during the duration of the buff.

So I built out a dialog that would store the location of the cache, and replicated the dialogs for importing specific characters from Rawr2. The problem I ran into was that I couldn't pull any data off the FileInfo file variable due to an access denied error out of Silverlight. If anyone can find a solution to get around this that would be a big help.</p>\r\n<p>Boss Handler : I'm still stuck on this development stream due to an inability to properly tie the DataBindings for the interface to where they need to be.
