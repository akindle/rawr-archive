    "Html": "&quot;Mangle+Rip+Roar5&quot; means that your rotation includes those spells. There's no more 'rotation' really, like a sequence of spells like there used to be (used to be Mangle, Shred to 4+cp, Rip, repeat). Now Cats use a priority system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways keep SR up (though not always the same # of cp). Always keep Rake up. Always keep Mangle up (handled by Trauma).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, it comes down to what spells to include: Mangle+Rip+Roar5. Shred isn't included, so you use Mangle for combo points (in addition to Rake). Rip is included, so you should keep a 5pt Rip up. Roar5 means to use 5cp Roars.<br>\r\n",

That's what I tried to convey, albeit poorly, in my earlier description of my rotation.</div><div><br></div><div>In my case:</div><div><br></div><div>0- keeping Mangle up is done by our trauma warrior</div><div>1- first priority 1: keep Savage Roar up (with at least 2 combo points, most of the times with 5)</div><div>2- second priority: keep Rip up (with at least 4 combo points)</div><div>3- third priority: keep Rake up (gives 1 or 2 combo points)</div><div><br></div><div>As you can see, the only action there that gives combo points (instead of consuming them) is rake. The real question boils down to: &quot;how do I get my combo points filled in&quot;.</div><div><br></div><div>So Rawr thinks the answer to that question is Mangle, not Shred. *This* is what I find hard to believe, given:</div><div><br></div><div>- my template includes all the shredding attacks and no improved mangle</div><div>- the Mangle debuf is irrelevant since the warrior handles it.</div><div>- individual shreds do far more damage than individual mangles</div><div><br></div><div>So what could account for such a superiority for Mangle? 35 energy vs 42 energy?

For now, I will hedge my bets and maintain two gear sets: a mangle set and a shred set, which will hopefully only differ by their idols.<div><br></div><div><br></div>",
