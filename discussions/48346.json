    "Html": "These issues are model and character independant. I tried different models and empty character sheets and it takes very long to build (or scroll through) the items list and to switch between the different models. Though I was wrong on the performance of talent point changing, this hasnt changed since the last Rawr version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess the new gem and enchant system recalculates every time you open an item list and takes to much performance on my computer.... which doesnt explain the long loading of the class modules though. That's hard to test, because there is some caching going on, which causes strongly reduced loading times of modules you have already loaded in the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've also noticed that Rawr has a lower memory usage... maybe that forces the program to reload more data from harddisk when building item lists? I'm noticing low blue curves (maximum HDD activity) in the resource monitor when working with Rawr. CPU activity is rather low. <br>\r\nWoW has high memory usage and HDD activity, that might further explain why Rawr is very slow when using Alt+Tab<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Ok I've done some more extensive testing on this, here's what I found out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe model-change lag isnt new. When I'm running WoW and many other applications it just takes its time, but there isnt an obious difference between 2.19 and 2.20. Sorry 'bout the misinformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item list performance though is obviously worse by several degrees between 2.19 and 2.20. This issue is model and character independant, I've tested every single model and used different character sheets. As mentioned before this occurs even with an emtpy char sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Im using the scroll bar I have a 1-3 seconds lag somewhere between top to bottom in almost 100% of the cases. In 2.19 the scrolling is fluent (besides some minor graphical skew when the list going really fast ^^). <br>\r\nSometimes it's getting worse, not displaying any list item at all for 5 seconds. The worst case I had was that the whole program didnt react for almost 15 seconds and Windows told me that there wasnt any reaction (dont know the English term, I'm using German Windows version, but it's displayed in the title frame).<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "That's very weird; nothing has changed to do what you're describing. Switching models should take a few sec. Switching charts should be near instantaneous. Scrolling around in charts should be absolutely instantaneous, there's really absolutely *nothing* going on there, calculation-wise. As soon as you load a chart, the whole chart is calculated, a long image is created for the whole chart, and that image is dropped in that frame, and is scrollable. Can you please try running 2.1.9 and 2.2.0 side by side (just leave them in different folders), and make the exact same actions in each one, and see if it really does happen only in 2.2? How many gemming templates are you using (default, haven't changed anything? Are you turning all of them on or something?)? If you download a fresh copy of 2.2.0b1, can you tell us the exact steps, click by click, of how to reproduce it?",
