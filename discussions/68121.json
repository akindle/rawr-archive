Everytime I open it, the screen only shows 1 trinket instead of both and when I try to maximize, increase the size of the window's borders or anything involving the window it doesn't solve the problem. So I was wondering how I can get it to show it the 2 trinkets (guessing it involves making it a smaller scale). Also can't see the bracers**.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>P.S I'm using Vista if that accounts for anything.</p>",
