I love how when I post it to Codeplex, there are 4 downloads, before I've even finished uploading it.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, this meant that my plan to catch up on my e-mail is pushed back yet another night. I'm over 150 e-mails behind. :( &nbsp;If you're waiting for a response to your e-mail to me, don't worry, I haven't forgotten, will just be another day or so, I hope.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>EDIT: Actually, it's not that bad. Over 100 of those are from TankDK users in the past 3 days reporting that it crashes, which I've responded from my iPhone to. (Thank god for copy and paste on the iPhone... Seems like after every time I wake up, or get out of a meeting, or come back from lunch, there were 15-20 more e-mails about it, which I could respond to all of them with 'Reply -&gt; Paste -&gt; Send -&gt; Next Email' x15-20)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I'm rambling, because it's 2am, and I'm half* drunk since I started drinking when the interwebs went down, so I'm off to bed. Rawr!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>*OK, more than half, I'm a total lightweight. Mmmmm... Bailey's...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>EDIT 2: Err, I remember what happened last time I released a new version while I was drunk. Lets hope this one is better than that one. *crosses fingers that he doesn't have another 50 emails in his inbox when he wakes up*</p>",
