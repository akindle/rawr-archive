When I force the trinket to a set mastery value (eg\r\n 450 mastery out of the 480 max stack), its value skyrockets. I have checked, and this is not due to reforging, if you equip the item and force it to not reforge, its value still goes up drastically. I believe there is an issue with how rawr.mage is currently\r\n modelling the mastery proc on DoT tick.</p>\r\n",
