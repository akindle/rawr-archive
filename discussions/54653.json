The rotation does not include Plague strike which is normal but when looking at the glyph it says to use glyph of plague strike... Only the glyph of OB is right in the three which should be Glyph of Howling blast and Glyph of Frost strike. anyway to adjust that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso with the newer version i cant download my char from the armory like other have stated. \r\n",

    "Html": "Those three glyph choices are left over from before glyph selection was homogenized, as they were the only ones implemented at the time. In the next release, they will be removed, and quite a few more glyphs will be implemented. Keep in mind, however, that glyphs such as howling blast and frost strike have no impact on the calculations, as it is up to the user to ensure that the entered rotation makes &quot;sense&quot; - that is, your runic power is at a point of breaking even, and the number of diseases and their uptime matches the number of diseases applied, regardless of what applies them.",
