So I tried to create a \"HIDE-filter\" as shown in the documentation, but when I write HIDE in the user note for the item it doesent remain there. When I go into the item editor for this item once again, the  user note is empty. I want to fix this problem because I want to import a proper upgrade list into the rawr ingame addon. Any suggestions how I can fix this problem?</p>",

I'll look into that issue.&nbsp; As well, you shouldn't be seeing many agility items,&nbsp; I fixed that bug a long time ago.&nbsp; So I'll look into the Frost DK specific stuff.&nbsp; Can't say much about the upgrade list at this point.</p>",
