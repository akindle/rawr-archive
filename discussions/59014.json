Trying to open in either VC#Express2008 or WebDev2008, I get the &quot;Project type is not supported by this installation&quot; error.</p>\r\n<p>My question is: Did I do something wrong and it should be opening in VC#2008? Or are other developers using Blend and it isn't really as slow and sluggish as it appeared on first use? Or is Blend just for the GUI creation and then you go back to VC# and implement the code interfacing to this GUI?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
