I fixed it, but got really busy before I could release the fix, and I apologize to everyone for having been gone from Rawr for so long.  I am intending on getting everything fixed up and releasing a version with at least nominal 5.4 compatibility (for whatever classes happen to be ready) by the time 5.4 comes out.  I would like to do an interim release this weekend to try to fix some of the errors.  Again, I sincerely apologize to the entire community - small as it is - for the lack of time and effort I've had available for this project this summer.<br />\n",
