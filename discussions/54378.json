Thank you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a tank I generally have two goals, to have high health, and to take as little damage as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me the one optimization option missing from the tank models (Bear and Prot Paladin at least, maybe DK and Warrior have them) is the ability to opimize damage taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI end up trying all kinds of other optimizations to see which gets me the lowest, it would be so much easier if you just optimize that one target item with a constraint on health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you.\r\n",
