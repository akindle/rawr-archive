Rawr's calculations are accurate. Gemming ArPen can indeed produce higher DPS than Agi at higher gear levels, but it's much significantly than 250, and varies quite alot that by other stats. Regardless, ArPen is being nerfed in 3.2.2 (which is likely to be this tuesday), making it almost impossible for ArPen to beat Agi in all but the most extreme circumstances, so you'd be wasting a ton of epic red gems if you gemmed ArPen at this point.</p>",

It's so poor, that it definitely impacts the 'accessibility' of it. And it's much harder to find defects in his code by noticing patterns in the outputs, since it's so hard to provide lots of inputs.

If there's one thing Rawr has taught me, it's that the 'cookie cutter' cases are actually rare; everyone's got a different selection of gear available to them, commonly from a wide variety of instances/sources, so no magic rule works in practice for a significant portion of the user-base.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(P.S.

Several of the things you list are specifically improvements that I'd love to do, given the time. If I said &quot;these things can't be fixed&quot;, I'd be ashamed. To respond specifically:</p>\r\n<p><em>- 100% Rip uptime although even the simplest begin-of-fight analysis can see that you don't &nbsp;have rip up for at least 6 GCD's of the fight, even if you play perfectly the rest of the way.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>I'd like to add calculation for the initial build-up, yes.</p>\r\n<p><br><em>- You don't achieve 100% rake uptime, realistically, in any scenario when you need to maintain mangle, SR, and Rip. &nbsp;If you disagree, show me evidence that this is the case (any parse from in-game would be fine, even from a training dummy.)&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>There's definitely a point in that 100% isn't&nbsp;achievable&nbsp;due to lag variance, and that affects Rake alot more than Rip. Same with simply screwing up. Beyond that, there are collisions on multiple skills coming off at the same time. I'd like to add reductions to the effective duration of Mangle and SR to account for having to refresh them early, due to collisions. I'd also like to add an option for lag variance.</p>\r\n<p><br><em>- You don't calculate misses into your bleed uptimes.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>Simply untrue. They are indeed calculated. They're applied as an effective increase to the duration of the bleed, but not to its total damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><br></em><em>- You don't &nbsp;have any correction to realize that you typically don't have the energy to mangle twice, rake twice, and shred three times in order to maintain uptime on all three when they all need to occur (occasionally) within a typical cycle. &nbsp;So you can't have 100% uptime on mangle and rake while extending rip every cycle. &nbsp;Also, you'd need to use another finisher because you'd have too many CP.</em></p>\r\n<p>I do it all the time; it's totally possible (short of the rake uptime lost to lag variance, of course).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>- &nbsp;You don't sacrifice rip uptime for FB, ever, even a single tick. I can guarantee you that you get more damage from sacrificing a tick of Rip for an FB.</em></p>\r\n<p>Another point I'd love to implement, given time.</p>\r\n<p><em><br></em><em>- You calculate your number of FBs by taking the overall CP available, then calculating the energy cost, and dividing it. &nbsp;In other words, you assume that all attacks that generate CP will be used efficiently. &nbsp;I'm amazed someone who has played the game thinks that no CP get wasted (for instance, shreds on OoC procs while already at 5 CP and waiting for the next finisher). &nbsp;If you tried to play this way, you'd also find that you have decent odds of not having enough CP when it's time for your next finisher.</em></p>\r\n<p>And yet another, kind of. Proper energy pooling solves this to a huge extent (as well as just not using FB), but I realize not entirely. This is a definitely one problem that a simulator would easily handle, and is difficult to handle in a closed form model. However difficult, I do want to attempt to account for this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I strongly believe that Rawr should encourage you to play better, and optimize your performance while doing so, rather than optimizing your performance while playing poorly.</p>",

The WMO Ignis and Jaraxxus leaderboards have no one approaching 30% total damage from Rip+FB (The highest I found was roughly 27%.)<br>- FBN has less than 100% bleeds when hit capped-- (thank you for explaining where the misses/dodges come in); it's rare to find parses with over 90% uptime, especially among top DPSers. &nbsp;The top bleed percentage I could find from US players in the top 20 on Jaraxxus was 92% (99 ticks in 3 minutes, 36 seconds.)&nbsp;<br>- Similarly, I can't find a single parse on the Jaraxxus leaderboards with rake damage over 10.6% of total damage-- and he only had 92% uptime, and his rakes crit 15% more than his other attacks, and that parse didn't FB; for the gear levels of those players, FBN lands near 9% and SC lands at 10%, while I've seen few configurations of gear where Rawr is under 11% (on my character for instance, Rake is 12.5%, although I'm not in endgame gear). &nbsp;Most players on the leaderboard are near 8-9%.</p>\r\n<p>-Both tools overestimate DPS relative to in-game, but FBN is ~500 DPS closer to reality than Rawr.</p>\r\n<p>You say FBN's are probably wrong based on a glance at his code; I say Rawr seems more wrong based on the fact its outputs are further away from in-game results, and a lot more people can see the second and confirm that. &nbsp;For every user where the tool is a black box, they have to assume Rawr is doing a worse job at the cycle theorycraft than FBN, so they'll trust FBN more. &nbsp;The issues I outlined in the last post are very directly causing the differences between Rawr and reality. &nbsp;And I contend that they're bigger flaws than anything happening in the FBN code, based on outputs.</p>\r\n<p>I wish they'd use SC instead of FBN as its outputs are similarly accurate, fairly customizable (including decision-making), better written, and more easily repeatable, but that's beside the point.</p>\r\n<p>I'm not advocating accomodating poor play. &nbsp;I'm advocating a model of the best possible play as opposed to the impossibly good, which is what Rawr.Cat is right now. &nbsp;It's clearly beyond the upper bound of possible-- and not an &quot;impossible for a person to actually execute&quot; kind of way, but an &quot;impossible for the mechanics to occur like that&quot; kind of way. &nbsp;And the numbers are coming out wrong. &nbsp;And FBN's, if incorrect, are at least closer to right.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To address the individual point which I may have miscommunicated-- I didn't mean to say that it's impossible to mangle twice, rake twice, shred three times, and cast three finishers in a single rip period-- you can, with enough OoC procs or TF or berserk. &nbsp;My point was that the scenario exists that you can't maintain all three if you don't get OoC procs over that period and your TF/Berserk is on cooldown. &nbsp;Even if you rip at 100 energy (and not when the timer expires). &nbsp; &nbsp;It happened to me just last night, after a rip with high energy and expiring mangle/rake right afterwards. &nbsp;I'm not saying it's a major issue; I'm just saying that it's the kind of edge-scenario which will always exist in calculators that average-case things that happen sporadically, like averaging the energy you get from OoC. &nbsp;And it can make a difference. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

With no raid buffs, we were able to maintain ~90-93% uptime on both bleeds, with him Mangling, and me PvP spec'd (-4% crit). I'd attribute 3-5% of that to lag variance (ie, just not stacking them tight enough, without overlapping), and the other 2-7% due to simply <em>screwing up.</em>&nbsp;That will go up with the increased combo point generation and energy generation of being in a raid, but down due to fight mechanics. And in the interest of full disclosure, it also helps that he plays on the same subnet as our server, and I play only 2 hops away. Yay for 5ms and 13ms pings. Too bad the server doesn't process things that discretely.</p>\r\n<p>As I've said, I'd like to move the upper bound down from 100% to [100%-lag variance], since that's what's actually possible.

While various claims can be made that one is &quot;right&quot; and the other is &quot;wrong&quot;, ultimately, their DPS ends up being similar despite significantly different damage profiles: one which benefits more from Agi/AP, and one which benefits more from ArP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The recommendation from my end is to guarantee that the gear matches the playstyle, which matches the theorycraft.&nbsp; Rawr.Cat is still in a bit of flux in that matter until the FB problem and the collision problem get solved as it's doing both at the same time right now: lots of bleeds while simultaneously, lots of bites.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it might be a middle-ground estimate right now, but it's still a little skewed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
