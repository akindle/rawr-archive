Take Healadin for example - Powerword: Fort as a buff is not available, also enchants like Glyph of the Galdiator&nbsp;are not available either.&nbsp; Now some will say why would you have it, as it's not a Healing buff. But there are some fights that require high levels of stamina for survival - and having them all available can help make decisions regarding what to put on gear for different encounters. &nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;\r\n",
