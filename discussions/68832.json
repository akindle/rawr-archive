I have been using Rawr for a while now and have learned how to work past this but only now thought i might ask here for some help.</p>\r\n<p>It seems that ever since i started using Rawr i sometimes find myself receiving inconsistant results when using the optimiser. For example using the same buffs/talents/option/rotation settings...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>-&gt; If i have 3 pieces of hand items selected the optimiser will suggest a score value of *X using Hand Item (1) in conjunction with various other pieces. If i then go and disable Hand Item (3) leaving only Hand Item (1) and (2) to be used it will result in a score of *X + Y (with some other gear swapped around this time) or sometimes will not be able to reach score *X at all again (resulting in *X - Y) until i add back Hand Item (3), even tho it is never used in the setup? Any help or explanations as to what i may be doin wrong would really help me out!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank a bunch for the great app again!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>*You can sub any value in here, i.e X = 2000 and Y = 50</p>",

It should be pretty rare though; if you're seeing it repeatedly, you should turn the thoroughness up. (This is all because to actually try every possible combination would take <em>literally</em>&nbsp;<em>eons, no exaggeration</em>, so it tries to intelligently choose sets to try, and thus we get a thoroughness setting.)</p>",
