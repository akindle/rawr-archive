Been personally using Libram of Renewal and wanted to see what Rawr says about the new librams. According to Rawr both librams are upgrades - Veracity about 10-15% Binding Light 25-30%, yet when I equip&nbsp;1 of them&nbsp;my total&nbsp;healing output (according Rawr)&nbsp;goes down by a lot, also Rawr stops showing Glyph of Seal of Wisdom as best Glyph (Glyph of Seal of Light instead) and Int gems (spell power gems) instead. Now I have modeled the procs as best I could but I'm pretty sure that's illogical for the complete gearsetup to change because a Libram has been switched. Below are libram procs as I have modeled them:</p>\r\n<p>Veracity: 234 SP (15 secs 35% on Healingspellcast) with a 10 sec internal cooldown</p>\r\n<p>Binding Light: 3 x 85 SP (15 secs 30% on Healingspellcast) with no internal cooldown</p>\r\n<p>I'm kinda hoping some of the developers already tried this out and can confirm&nbsp;if my modeling is wrong (or if another libram really changes the whole picture ? )</p>\r\n<p>Thank you in advance :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
