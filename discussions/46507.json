Â i've removed the entire folder and re-synced from the source depository with no change. clearly something isn't happy. perhaps i need the svn visual studio plugin? i am using tortoise svn instead. I've included some screen shots at the end. Of course, the resto shaman module is the one I am interested in... any ideas?<div><br></div><div><span style=\"white-space:pre;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px\">http://img131.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1wj3.png</span></div><div><span style=\"white-space:pre;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px\"></span></div><div><span style=\"white-space:pre;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px\">http://img19.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture2fb3.png<br></span></div><div><span style=\"white-space:pre;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px\"></span></div><div><span style=\"white-space:pre;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px\">http://img19.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture3gf8.png<br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px;white-space:pre\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11px;white-space:pre\"><br></span></div>",
