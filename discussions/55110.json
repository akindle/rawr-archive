I cannot equip or add gemming using Dragon's Eye Gems. They do not show on the list. The items I have equipped still have the gems in them though, so I know the program can see them. <br>\r\nI re loaded the program.............Nothing.<br>\r\nI re downloaded the program and reloaded again...........Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did those gems go?\r\n",
