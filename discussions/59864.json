I understand the building from source code part, and it works great with Visual C# Express, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how to patch the source code. I tried using Cygwin but I don't know the commands. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>P.S. The patch I'm referring to is Lord Helmchen's Elemental patch, ID 2993.</p>\r\n<p>P.P.S. I have TortoiseSVN installed, and I tried right-clicking Elemental.Patch and selecting &quot;Apply patch...&quot; but it gives me an error message: The line indicating the new file was expected in line 2 ! Doing it the long way by actually opening TortoiseMerge isn't working either.</p>",
