It appears to just provide a quick listing of your heals and casting times for each.</p>\r\n<p>I'm gonna suggest, based on other class specs, that there might not be a &quot;standard&quot; rotation. There might be a &quot;priority&quot; rotation (one spell having priority over another) or simply it varies too much from one fight to another.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully a paladin player can give more insight.</p>",
