Just recently I level up JC so I could take advantage of dragon gems. And I set the default template in the gems to show this. I also made those gems avaiable for optimization.</p>\r\n<p>My problem is this... When I optimize, many times the app will tell me to switch around gems for no real reason. Doesn't activate any piece bonus. Doesn't change the quantity of each gem either. Just plays music chairs with them.</p>\r\n<p>I think I must be doing something wrong as this never happened before I became a JC and had Dragon gems available.</p>\r\n<p>I'm new to posting on the forums here, so I do not see how I can attach my charactor.xml for you to see. I wish I could. You could see this weird behavior in action.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any help that you guys can provided.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
