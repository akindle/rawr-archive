The description of the module says &quot;...<span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_Content_TabContentPanel_Content_wikiSourceLabel\">if you'll stick to more or less normal fight conditions you can enable Global Optimizations.&quot; What exactly are normal fight conditions? What does the global optimizer do differently? I noticed that if I put Frost Resistance to 100%, and had Global Optimizations unchecked, it suggested I wand for a good chunk of the fight and use a standard rotation for the rest. But if I checked Global Optimizations, it replaced both wanding and the rotation with repeated scorches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes checking Global Optimizations just make Rawr look through more possible attack rotations?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\n</span>\r\n",
