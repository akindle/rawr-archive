Was reading a news post on <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=5857&tag=wrapper;col1\">ZDNet</a> how Visual Studio 2010 was being released today and at the end of the article, they mention that Silverlight 4 is being released tomorrow. This got me worried about compatibility with RAWR 3 since Most Vista and Windows 7 computers will have Silverlight 4 set to install using Windows Automated Update within the next month. Granted these types of updates are usually optional, but you will have people updating the program anyway without much thinking.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Well that's good to hear. If it means anything, apparently the new Windows Phone 7 platform uses Silverlight as it's primary development environment. Something for people who like phone apps can look into if they have a phone that has support for the Windows platform. Granted, like mentioned in the Droid thread, the program is processory heavy so it may not be best to be run on a phone, but I'm just giving the heads up that theoretically RAWR can be used on a phone, just, as it stands, only on Windows Phone 7 plateform phones.</p>\r\n<p>http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=5827&amp;tag=col1;post-5827 for more info</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
