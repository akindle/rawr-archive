I currently have several items equipped that aren't showing up in the comparisons window. Specifically, I have the Headdress of the High Potentate from Karazhan. I do have a few other pieces that aren't showing up in the window either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see the &quot;Fight HPS&quot; for the item when I chart my current gear, but not when I chart the &quot;Gear&gt;Head&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have edited the pieces in the Comparisons window, and the only way I can get it to show up there is to duplicate the item, then change the item type into &quot;Plate&quot;. Is there an easier way to do this? If so, I'd like to know :)<br>\r\n",
