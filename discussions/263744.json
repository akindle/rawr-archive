Some of the items do show who the horde vender is however it would be VERY tedius to add in the horde vender. Also keep in mind that the source info can only hold up to 3 sources. So some of the items will not have the room for the extra vender info. However there are items, such as the Tol Barad trinkets that have faction specific prerequisites. These are are automatically filtered for your faction.</p>",
