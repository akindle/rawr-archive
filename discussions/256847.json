    "Html": "<p>Optimizing cooldown stacking is part of normal computations in Mage model. You can see the results in Solution\\Spell Cycles part of Stats.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to go more in detail you'll probably want to enable reconstruct sequence in advanced options and play with the advanced solver. The mage specific sequence reconstruction chart is useful when working with this. To experiment with how much impact different stacking options have on dps you'll want to use the cooldown editor under tools.</p>\r\n<p>If you have any more specific questions I'd be happy to help.</p>",
