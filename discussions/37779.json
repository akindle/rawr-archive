I have been using it to tweak my prot pally to get the most out of the equipment I have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do have one suggestion for the Tankadin. I have seen that the warrior and other models have several more optimization requirements available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel that an optimization requirements like Health, Armor, Spellpower, dodge, block, miss, ect. could be most useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BEG* Please try to add these to the Tankadin model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you.<br>\r\n",
