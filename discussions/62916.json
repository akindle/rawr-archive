However, I'm not much of a graphic designer (or at least, don't have enough time to put into it), so I'm calling to the community for help! Any good with making this sort of thing? Help out! I'll pick the best from all the submissions to be used as the logo and icon for Rawr v3. Details as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Icon must come in sizes <strong>16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Logo must look good on a<strong> light colored background</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Deadline is <strong>August 7th</strong>. (<em>Updated: Moved to Aug7, so as not to coincide with Blizz's Fan Art Contest)</em></li>\r\n<li>You don't have to submit both an icon and a logo, just one of them is fine too.</li>\r\n<li>Icon can be of anything WoW related that you think would represent Rawr.</li>\r\n<li>Logo should contain the Rawr name, and may or may not include the icon.</li>\r\n<li>To submit an icon/logo, e-mail it to cnervig@hotmail.com. I will be posting them here in this thread, as they're sent to me.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;I look forward to seeing what you all can come up with! Let me know if there are any questions. :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Entries So Far</strong></p>\r\n<p>Potential Logo #1<br><img src=\"http://files.getdropbox.com/u/38028/RawrLogo1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>Potential Logo #2<br><img src=\"http://files.getdropbox.com/u/38028/RawrLogo2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>",
