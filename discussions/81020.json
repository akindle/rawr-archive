The 2-piece basically gives 3-6 extra shreds over the course of the fight (depending on how long the fight lasts).</p>\r\n<p>The 4-piece allows your rake, which you should have up 90-95% of the time, to crit. This values increases more, the more crit you have. The more crit you have, the more chances your rake will crit. Because rake falls under special attacks, it's not affected by the white crit cap (79.8% crit).</p>",
