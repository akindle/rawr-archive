There are advantages and disadvantages to each form:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99%; border: grey 1px solid;\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7%; font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" align=\"center\">Silverlight (Browser)</td>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" align=\"center\">WPF (Downloadable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">What is it?</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46%; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">For those of you who don't know, Rawr4 is a port of Rawr to Silverlight.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46%; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">We've also placed our WPF Version into Release from Beta/Alpha stage. The WPF Version is a download-able EXE type client just like Rawr2 was.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">How&nbsp;Do I Run it?</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\"><strong>In your Web Browser</strong> (Firefox, Opera,&nbsp;Safari, Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc) or optionally, <strong>installed</strong> to your system in <strong>Out of Browser</strong> (OOB) Mode.</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">Downloaded and run as an <strong>Executable</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">What OS's does it work with?</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows</strong> (XP, Vista, 7) (32 or 64 Bit) </li>\n<li><strong>Mac OS X</strong> and newer </li>\n<li>Does not work in <strong>Linux</strong> until the <a title=\"Moonlight Project\" href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight\">Moonlight 4 project</a> completes (there is no ETA on this, Moonlight 2 it too out of date) </li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows</strong> (XP, Vista, 7) (32 or 64 Bit) </li>\n<li>Does not work in <strong>Mac OS X</strong>&nbsp;or newer </li>\n<li>Does not work in <strong>Linux</strong> until the <a title=\"Moonlight Project\" href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight\">Moonlight&nbsp;WPF project</a> completes (there is no ETA on this) </li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">How does it get Updates?</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Automatically.</strong> The Browser page will always have the latest version. The OOB install will download updates in the background&nbsp;and prompt you to restart Rawr and then you are done.</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Manually.</strong> You will be promted to go to the Rawr website and download a new version yourself to unzip. We highly recommend the free utility <strong>7-zip</strong>, as it's much faster than the Windows built in zip compression tool.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">Where is it?</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">Get started at: <strong><a title=\"http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php\" href=\"http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php\">http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php </a></strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">See the <strong>Downloads Page</strong> on this site.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold; border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">How Well Does it Run?</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">\n<div>This version has had <strong>longer development time</strong> and is the primary development method for most models (the code is shared to WPF). This means it has a&nbsp;generally more <strong>stable</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong> User Interface (UI).</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border: grey 1px solid;\" valign=\"top\">This version hasn't had as long in development but the major advantage here is <strong>Performance</strong>.&nbsp;There is about a 20% performance boost when using the WPF version over Silverlight, this has to do with optimization technologies in the back end code for WPF that does not translate into SL. This isn't something we can just do in Silverlight and for those wanting/needing the performance over portability, WPF is for you.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For questions on the <strong>Development Status</strong> for a particular model, there is a <strong>status bar message</strong> in the lower right hand corner of the application.

Go into Silverlight settings and allow it. </li>\n<li>Cannot Launch Rawr because the <strong>ItemCache </strong>loads in and breaks due to <strong>HolyShield being a bad Trigger</strong> (or some other similar nonsense)<br />- You need to delete your Rawr3 saved caches, Right-click the window, choose Silverlight go to the last tab (named Application Storage) and select elitistjerks.com then click the Delete button, then Relaunch Rawr (or refresh the browser page) </li>\n<li>You got into Rawr but there are <strong>no Items present</strong><br />- Your ItemCache didn't load for whatever reason. Go to Tools &gt; Reset All Caches to redownload the new data </li>\n<li><strong>Install Offline</strong> button <strong>doesn't work</strong><br />- You probably already installed it offline, right click anywhere and it will tell you \"Remove Application\" in the menu if you have </li>\n<li><strong>Google Chrome Users</strong>, it looks like you need to force the browser to refresh the page instead of running the cached version using <strong>Shift+F5</strong>. Otherwise you will see the old version and that can cause other crashes since new data files have been posted. </li>\n<li><strong>Silverlight </strong>does not appear to work in <strong>IE 64 Bit</strong>, you will have to switch to <strong>IE 32 bit</strong>. </li>\n<li>For those who need it, Silverlight 4 can be loaded <strong>without admin privileges</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Get Portable Firefox from <a href=\"http://portableapps.com/\">Portable Apps</a> </li>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fdownloads%2Fdetails.aspx%3FFamilyID%3D298170d6-567c-4b90-9917-490ffcddba87&amp;rct=j&amp;q=silverlight%204%20SDK&amp;ei=91v-TLrsCsGB8ga_3eCvBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7PDQqJc4q3ZOrmlZdnXPv9DVayg&amp;cad=rja\">Silverlight 4 SDK</a> </li>\n<li>Extract the SDK with something like WinRar or 7-Zip, you should see a silverlight_sdk.cab file </li>\n<li>Extract the .cab file </li>\n<li>Copy everything from the .cab file into the plugins directory of Portable Firefox (You probably don't need all the files, but I know that works) </li>\n<li>Start (or restart) Portable Firefox, and check to make sure Silverlight is loaded as a plugin (Add-ons-&gt;Plugins) </li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>We also have a Troubleshooting page which outlines a series of things for you to attempt BEFORE posting an issue:</strong><br /><a title=\"Troubleshooting\" href=\"http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Troubleshooting\" target=\"_blank\">http://rawr.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Troubleshooting</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> We apologize for the confusion with the 4.1.0 release, something went wrong with the build and post process where the updated version didn't actually post to EJ.</p>",
