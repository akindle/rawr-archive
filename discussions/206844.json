You're still welcome to continue using Rawr2, but we urge you to try out Rawr3, and enjoy all the new features and benefits. Rawr3 is a port of Rawr to Silverlight, which means:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can run Rawr3 in your web browser.</li>\r\n<li>No need to download or install anything.</li>\r\n<li>It runs on Mac OS X (Intel). Welcome to Rawr, Mac users!</li>\r\n<li>You can optionally install it locally with 2 clicks from the web version, if you want to have it locally for offline use.</li>\r\n<li>Lots more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So give Rawr3 a try today! Get started at:   <a title=\"http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php\" href=\"http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php\">http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php </a></p>\r\n<p>Please remember that it's still a beta, though, so lots of things are likely to be buggy or incomplete!</p>",

You guys have been working really hard on this and I'm glad to see it come to fruition. :)</p>\r\n<p>Being Rawr3, the harbinger of my doom, I tried it with Mono/Moonlight 3 to see what my future holds ...and it actually loads now! There's hope for me, yay! ^^ Looks really nice too. It's not currently usable in Moonlight, but it loads and I can armory the characters I tried.</p>\r\n<p>Would you be interested in an extensive Moonlight support test during this phase of testing, or would you like me to wait until Rawr3 goes stable? Also, I would like to request the WPF version be put up somewhere with a regular link since Moonlight doesn't support the install method Rawr3 tries to call. I'd really like to test it. :)</p>",

This is after optimizing for more hit. Either the calculation is way off or Rawr's mixing up &quot;miss&quot; and &quot;target miss&quot; [which, by the way, could be worded a little better, target miss has nothing to do with the target missing, but I'm assuming this is limited to the TankDK module]</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<br>Another note about TankDK, for some reason it's also insisting that I wear my DPS set's boots over tank ones, which is absurd.<br><br>Tank - http://www.wowhead.com/?item=46997<br>DPS - http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50788<br><br>Either it's weighting Expertise way too heavily (I'm already around 36 Exp) or it's disregarding the strength gems I have forced onto the DPS boots.<br><br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<br>By the way, what happened to Cost? Does it not take set bonuses into account anymore? If I optimize with 400 badges [enough to buy 4pc t10 and then some], it still prefers to take the 264 non-tier stuff. Perhaps the stats from 264 pieces are more valuable than 4pc set bonuses [doubt it], but then it doesn't recognize that the tier is upgradeable either? Is there a way to implement that?<br><br>Speaking of Cost, why was the Triumph option removed? It's still the base badge, and any toon gearing up [aka those not yet 11/12 ICC aka those with enough gear options to benefit from using Rawr regularly] would probably still like a Triumph cost option, no?<br><br>It's as simple as putting &quot;Load Emblem of Triumph&quot; back in there, but it would really shine if there were a way to use both at once. Say you have 100T and 60F, it could optimize for the best usage of the combination.</p>",

The point of Rawr (at least why I always used it) was to see in some theroy on how changes would effect me.

Regaurdless of what my first language is, and yes it is english, how about addressing my orginal and again repeated requests to take this off of public beta and list it\r\n as what it is, a good alpha or preview version.</span></p>\r\n",
