For most of us, its simply a case of throwing on a few PvP items for certain raid fights like Najentus but it occured to me that RAWR might be able to help with planning a +sta set that doesnt gimp our role too much. Sure, we can try on items and see the results and mess around with the gear that way but is there a more scientific or logical method for selecting and planning the +sta set?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacha <br>\r\n",
