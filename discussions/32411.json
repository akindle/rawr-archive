The problem I have is every new release flushes my items list and I end up readding a lot of items notin Rawr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can I transfer the items from b14.1 to b15? Which files? Is that recommended? Will I &quot;lose&quot; some new stuff from b15 in doing so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help is appreciated, thanks!\r\n",

    "Html": "If it's items on a character (including available items), just opening that character in b15 will readd the items. That's the easiest way to 'transfer' items. However, if you really want, you can try just replacing b15's ItemCache.xml with yours from b14.1. I'm not 100% sure that it'll read it OK, but about 80% sure. Can't hurt to try, as long as you keep a backup of your b15 ItemCache.xml. :)<br>\r\n",
