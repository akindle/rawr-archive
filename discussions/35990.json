But I really don't want to equip cloth items on my toon, so I want to be able to choose what types of armor I will see in this list. I would do like a toolstripButton with a checkbox list with tho armor type names, so the user can choose the types he/she want to see in the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n@Comparisons: Same thing. I don't want to see &quot;Sunfire Robe&quot; as a upgrade of my chestpiece. :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest regards. =]~\r\n",
