The idea is that I just do not want to\r\n spend extra resources on anything below item-level 346. And I think that the same feature, if it's available, would be very useful with enchants. I would love to make epic or highest-score enchants only available for 359&#43; items, but nothing below that. Apologies\r\n if this is already answered somewhere else, a pasted link to an existing page with the info will be enough and appreciated.</p>\r\n",
