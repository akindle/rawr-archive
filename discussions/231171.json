Just add new item in item browser&nbsp;like you would add a real item, but instead of a real item id use some large number out of range of normal items. After that look for item named [Downloading from Armory]. Obviously since it doesn't really exist it'll stay that way, so just click on edit and enter your own stats and name.</p>",
