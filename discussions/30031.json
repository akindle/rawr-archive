I was wondering if anyone knew how Rawr was modeling this set bonus and if this modeling was intended. Or, (the most likely) that I have screwed something up. <br>\r\n",

    "Html": "It's quite possible, it's a solid set bonus. While you say that no other gear is good enough to break the set bonus, that's probably true for 1 item, but try multiple items. Just using T5-&gt;T6 as an example, 4T5+1T6 may be better than 3T5+2T6, but try 2T5+3T6. You'll most likely need to pick up two upgrades before it's worth dropping it. That's just how set bonuses work. Some are skyhigh in value (try finding a way to upgrade from 2T5 for an arc mage, or 2T4 for a cat).<br>\r\n",
