Now has ability to :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Export a Pawn addon string to clipboard<br>\r\n2) View weighted upgrades on Wowhead.com<br>\r\n3) View weighted upgrades on Lootrank.com&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feature I wanted for quite a while :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a heads up to any other using Rawr in case they missed the latest source builds :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nedit: now that I tried it, I have a smallish request for the export function. Is it possible you can add gems as well? Like take the highest ranked gems that fits the socket-colors and highest ranked metagem. I know at least Pawn supports it, not sure about the websites. While matching socket-color is not always the best combination, its probably as good as you can do.<br>\r\n",

I'm not a Pawn user - I prefer Equivalence Points (which I must add to the export) so I have no idea of what needs to go in the &quot;Pawn string&quot; to make that work. If someone can tell me I can probably code it.<br>\r\n",
