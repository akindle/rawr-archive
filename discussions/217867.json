With a minor tweak to the rules, I can even turn the jagged haste curve into a smoothed out curve.&nbsp; The nice part is that the LO solver can handle 2T10 while only adding a very small amount of calculation time. Whereas the ret sim now makes 2T10 take 10-15 more time than a non 2T10 setup.</p>\r\n<p>The LO engine finds the&nbsp;result just a bit faster than the ret sim does now. But that LO engine is highly tuned C++ code.<br>I translated a part of the LO engine to a C# class, and compared performance to just using that same part in the LO engine.<br>Extrapolating the result, translated to C#, the LO solver would end up being a factor 50+ times slower than the already slow 2T10 sim.&nbsp; From what I can see, the vast majority of time is being wasted in the .NET memory allocator and garbage collector.&nbsp; The C++ code uses a hand crafted assembler and multi thread aware class purpose allocator/deallocator and barely spends any time in memory management, even though it's doing tons of new/delete's.</p>\r\n<p>It was an interesting experiment, but I'm going to have to cancel this line of thought.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'll try poking you on MSN over the weekend to&nbsp;talk about this and have a see&nbsp;if your mage&nbsp;LP might do the trick.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
