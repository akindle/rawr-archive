From now on one diamond equals one instance of an item. So if you have 2 of the same item either mark them both with blue diamond\r\n or one with blue and one green. You'll obviously need to use the re-x options for optimizations in this case otherwise the blue diamond items won't be able to be changed. The back end supports having 2 green diamonds, but I don't know if there's any nice way\r\n to present that in the gui.</p>\r\n<p>I'll put up a beta release for anyone that's using batch tools and would like to test this. It will need a lot of testing because it's possible that some side effects were introduced. Please post any issues you find regarding any unexpected optimization\r\n results.</p>\r\n",
