    "Html": "<p>Although I completely agree with Astrylian that you don't need many templates in order to catch almost all but the outside fringe cases (which can be handled by Custom gemmings) I would say that in looking the ProtPaladin module may have too few GemmingTemplates to cover the various angles.</p>\r\n<p>Right now, the ProtPaladin module has:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>                    <span style=\"color:Green\">//Red           Yellow      Blue        Prismatic   Meta</span>\r\n                    { sovereign,    enduring,   solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced Threat + Avoidance, Austere</span>\r\n                    { sovereign,    enduring,   solid,      solid,      eternal },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced Threat + Avoidance, Eternal</span>\r\n                    { solid,        solid,      solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Max Stam, Austere</span>\r\n                    { solid,        solid,      solid,      solid,      eternal },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Max Stam, Eternal</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>There is really no avoidance gemmings, even partially, without having threat gems as well. That strikes me as a bit odd since it seems strange not to have an avoidance red option to go along with endurings. It also means that the only tri-color matched gemming template involves a threat gem, which may not be needed.</p>\r\n<p>ProtWarr uses:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>                    { flashing, flashing,   flashing,   flashing,   austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Max Avoidance (Parry)</span>\r\n                    { subtle,   subtle,     subtle,     subtle,     austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Max Avoidance (Dodge)</span>\r\n                    { flashing, glimmering, defender,   flashing,   austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Avoidance Heavy (Parry)</span>\r\n                    { subtle,   stalwart,   regal,      subtle,     austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Avoidance Heavy (Dodge)</span>\r\n                    { defender, enduring,   solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced Avoidance (Parry)</span>\r\n                    { regal,    enduring,   solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced Avoidance (Dodge)</span>\r\n                    { guardian, enduring,   solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced TPS</span>\r\n                    { solid,    solid,      solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Max Health</span>\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Although this is potentially slightly overkill (I'm considering removing the pure avoidance ones, as nobody actually gems that way in practice) it does catch some cases that the Paladin module does not.</p>\r\n<p>I would consider adding at least:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>                    { defender, enduring,   solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced Avoidance (Parry)</span>\r\n                    { regal,    enduring,   solid,      solid,      austere },  <span style=\"color:Green\">// Balanced Avoidance (Dodge)</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>As those are both very viable gemming templates for any tank to consider. If the eternal meta is viable for Paladins (I know it isn't for Warriors) then obviously those would need to have versions which used that as well. It may also be possible to drop the Parry gemming, however post-3.2 it actually can become a more viable gemming than Dodge due to the new DR curves.</p>",

Take &quot;Sta &gt; Parry, Hit&quot; for example. The primary goal there is survival, obviously, because you're using stamina as the base. But the secondary goals are conflicting; parry is for mitigation, hit is for threat. So in an item with 1 yellow and 1 red socket, it'd have sta/hit and sta/parry, which is very odd. It's extremely unlikely that you'd gem for both mitigation AND threat in the same item. Sure, it's possible, when you want to be hit capped and are only 8 hit short of the cap, but otherwise want mitigation... But that's in the 1% of cases, that comparison charts are't supposed to cover.</p>\r\n<p>Also, regarding comparison charts vs optimizer... I think you may be missing Upgrade Lists. The Upgrade List is what you're looking for in the comparison chart, but accurate with the gear you have available.</p>",

For ProtPaladin (which inherited ProtWarr's code in this regard) and ProtWarr which already just loop over arrays, it would be easy enough to have two arrays--one for the metas and one for the primary templates--and loop over both to produce the result with like.. 3 extra lines of code, for deleting just as many or more, while handling all the combos.</p>",
