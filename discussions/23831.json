Would it be possible to add item dps overlayed on top of the total damage comparison?  Currently the total damage is redundantly listed within the bar and to the right of the bar so it might be a nice change to show the dps on the right instead.  Currently, in order to get the dps increase I have to equip the different item and then subtract the dps difference between the 2 items to figure this out.<br />",
