    "Html": "First of all, I would like to thank everyone for their efforts with Rawr. This is a great piece of software that I use often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the optimizer is very CPU Intensive, I find it very helpful to run Rawr on my netbook which is running at 1024x600 resolution. When doing this, I lose the bracer and bottom trinkets from the screen. Would it be possible to either add a scroll bar or resize the item icons when the resolution is under 1024x768? I'm not an expert programmer, but I'm pretty sure the former is easier, but would prefer the latter if possible. While many people have low-cost netbooks, I understand that netbooks are still a &quot;new craze&quot; and would be willing to test a lower-resolution friendly version as well as provide screenshots or any information that would make this easier for the Rawr team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunesaber<br>\r\nArthas\r\n",
