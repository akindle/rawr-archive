The only thing i would like to see added to the feral options. Is to be able to change talents and see how that affects mitigation and armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to see how maybe droping a point in thick hide would help mitigation.\r\n",

    "Html": "Well, that's too low priority to happen any time soon, ferals are just so cookie cutter. But what you can do if you want to see how dropping a point in Thick Hide would affect you, and you are able to edit xml, is edit BuffCache.xml and add a new buff. In the &lt;Stats&gt; tag, use &lt;BonusArmorMultiplier&gt;-0.027272727&lt;/BonusArmorMultiplier&gt;. That'll be give you a -2.727272% armor debuff, which is almost the same. It's not quite right, cause Thick Hide doesn't affect armor from agility, but it's decently close.",
