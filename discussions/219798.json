In order to separate it from my personal e-mail, and more importantly to get more eyes involved, I've setup a new e-mail account for the Rawr Dev Team: <strong>WarcraftRawr@gmail.com</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Everyone, please use that e-mail for Rawr related e-mails now. Myself, and several of the other devs have access to it, so you're more likely to get a quick response. Additionally, if you've sent me anything in the last few weeks and haven't gotten a response, go ahead and resend it to WarcraftRawr@gmail.com.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
