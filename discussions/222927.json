    "Html": "<p>Well, I wouldn't worry about model changes now. Personally I would not touch the modeling until about 2 months prior to release. Back when Wrath came out, the patch for it took place a month prior to the release of the expansion. Those last two month though, there was VERY LITTLE changes to the trees. There were some just minor tweeks here and there, but generally what we saw about a month prior to patch 3.0, was basically final. So having the models worked on 2 months prior to release is a good time to work on them. This goes with all tree talents, stats, etc.</p>\r\n<p>There is already some Cata stuff already in. Mastery stat is in just I have not gotten around to looking at WoWhead's import to allow for it (well I tried locally just was having issues changing the ptr website to cata.wowhead.com).</p>\r\n<p>Reforging could be implemented now just not activated.</p>\r\n<p>Racials would probably be put in that last 2 months, though having basic racial information (Worgens are considered Alliance, Goblins are considered Horde) can probably put in now.</p>\r\n<p>Items again will be last. Once things start settling down, I can start adding items to the list. If I remember correctly, back at the beginning of wrath, RAWR did have lvl 70 gear in Naxx time frame. But once Ulduar hit, the lvl 70 gear was phased out.</p>",
