The Nightsong two piece bonus is unchecked. In case it makes a difference, I have Nightsong Gloves and Legs equipped in RAWR.</p>\r\n<p>Is this a known bug? Couldn't find anything on it and since my DPS dropped a hell of a lot when I made that switch I think it's lost the four piece from Dreamwalker (correctly) but not factoring in the Nightsong - so it's not just display it's affecting calculations.</p>",

I can't believe I did that, I had the two resto pieces equipped, I should have checked the names properly instead of assuming since they were highest on the optimizer they were the moonkin set :(</p>\r\n<p>Switched to the two balance pieces and the set bonus shows up properly. Sadly two pieces T8 and two pieces T7 is still worse than four pieces T7 according to the Sustained damage points but I already expected that - and it's not by a massive amount (like when I had the resto pieces equipped lol).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks Dopefish, sorry for my nub mistake.</p>",
