I am a big fun of theorycrafting and this program seems to cover all aspects that i need .. at least from what i have seen this far.<br>\r\nToday i dowloaded the new 2.1.1 version, and it simply doesnt want to start.<br>\r\nAfter i run rawr.exe, the usual black window with the different modules icons appear, and in statusbar it says Loading, please wait.<br>\r\nBut after a couple of minutes it dissapears and nothing else happens.<br>\r\nNo suspect proces is left behind in task manager, and the processor cools down in a normal idle 1-2%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this i try the previous version .. that is 2.1 .. and it runs smoothly with no warnings or errors (so i'm stuck with it till i find the glitch).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am using Window Vista Ultimate on an AMD 64x2 platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny ideeas what should i try? \r\n",

Tried to load character from armory, received the js script error mentioned in a prior discussion. Was able to save the character and I closed the program then attempted to restart it.. Since then it has done exactly what the OP stated above. Begins to load then just disappears into a black hole.....(I assume :])<br>\r\n",
