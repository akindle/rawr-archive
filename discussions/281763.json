EJ suggests only using the armor and block value meta. Can someone explain why rawr is suggesting the\r\n mastery gem? Of course I understand mastery's importance in avoidance but from what I understand the mastery meta isn't as effective as the other two.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Monk</p>\r\n",
