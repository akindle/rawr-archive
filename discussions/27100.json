I just wanted to make sure that everyone working on this knows just how much they are appreciated by people. I imagine it must be tough getting mostly, bug report, feature requests or modeling issues so.<br /><br />Thanks for all the hard work this is an amazing application. If I could I'd buy you a beer or beverage of your choice.<br /><br /><br />\"Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so, too\"<br />----Voltaire.<br />",
