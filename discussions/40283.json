For example, in the balance tree for druids our Moonfury and our Earth and Moon talents are no longer<br>\r\n5 point talents. They now only require 3 points to max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonfury<br>\r\n&nbsp;Increases damage done by your Starfire, Moonfire, and Wrath by 3% / 6% /10%<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth and Moon<br>\r\nYour Wrath and Starfire spells have a 100% chance to apply the Earth and Moon effect, which increases spell<br>\r\ndamage taken by 4% / 9% / 13% for 12 seconds. Also increases your spell damage by 1% / 2% / 3%<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny chance we could see this changed in this new release?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: My apologies! If I had scrolled down the discussions a little bit I would have seen the thread that already<br>\r\naddresses this. Sorry for the redundancy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
