    "Html": "<p>Is on my todo list.\r\n</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Edit; You can try to figure out how many spells you cast every second. Like if you cast 0,5 spells per second, that trinket saves you 42*0,5 = 21 mana/second, or 105mp5. Many talents reduce the cost of spells, so if you cast a lot of cost reduced spells, this value is lower I'd guess most Priests will get somewhere between 100-80mp5 reduction in spell cost usage with this trinket.</p>\r\n",
