The difference here is because you have The Black Heart which has a 7k armor proc and Mongoose which is giving that Agility Proc. Taking those two off leaves 25788 in Rawr, only 4 off. I took a quick look at the items and noticed that in the item cache, Veranus' Bane (ID 45137) had -25.4 Armor and 25.4 BonusArmor. The Armory doesn't show this and neither does Wowhead so i have no idea why it's there. Got rid of that and we have 25792 exactly.</p>\r\n<p>BTW, Mongoose only has like 1/4 the total value of Bladewarding. On your toon directly it's even less valued than Adamantite Weapon Chain.</p>",
