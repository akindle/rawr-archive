# rawr-archive
Mirror of the now-defunct codeplex archive of legacy world of warcraft theorycrafting tool Rawr. This repo exists solely for historical purposes.

A source code mirror appears to be online at https://github.com/Ultis/rawr, last synced some time in 2011.

The releases were archived by codeplex as guid-named zip blobs in seemingly arbitrary numeric folders. Rawr b16.1 (the last TBC release) is https://github.com/akindle/rawr-archive/tree/main/releases/123. Rawr v2.3.22 (the last WotLK release) is https://github.com/akindle/rawr-archive/tree/main/releases/50. These clients run and, for the most part, work just fine. Note that their web functionality (various touchpoints for fetching data from wowarmory or wowhead) do not work. Wowhead integrations can probably be restored with a proxy to rewrite the requests from www.wowhead.com to tbc.wowhead.com or similar.
